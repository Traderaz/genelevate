# Quick Fix Steps

## The Issue
`process.env.NODE_ENV` doesn't work in client-side code, so it was still calling the wrong API.

## Fixed
Changed to check if you're on localhost using `window.location.hostname`

## Steps to Test

1. **Stop your dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. **Restart it**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache** (or use Incognito/Private window)

4. **Go to AI page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/ai
   ```

5. **Open browser console** (F12)

6. **Send a message**: "Can you help me with calculus?"

7. **Check console** - You should see:
   ```
   Using API endpoint: /api/ai/chat-simple isLocalhost: true
   ```

8. **Check Network tab** (F12 → Network):
   - Should show POST to `/api/ai/chat-simple`
   - Status should be 200 (not 500)
   - Response should be JSON (not HTML)

## If Still Failing

Send me the error from:
1. Browser Console (F12 → Console)
2. Network tab (F12 → Network → Click on the failed request → Response)

The console.log will tell us which endpoint it's trying to use!
