## 🔐 Security Rules

### Profile Pictures
```
allow read: if true; // Public read (profile pics are public)
allow write: if request.auth != null 
             && request.auth.uid == userId
             && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB max
             && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*'); // Images only
```

### Key Points:
- ✅ Users can only upload to their own folder
- ✅ File size limited to 5MB
- ✅ Only image files allowed
- ✅ Public read access (for displaying in UI)
- ✅ Authenticated write access only

---

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Firebase Storage Integration
```typescript
// Upload flow
const storageRef = ref(storage, `profile-pictures/${userId}/${fileName}`);
await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);
const downloadURL = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);

// Update Firestore
await updateDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId), {
  photoURL: downloadURL,
  updatedAt: new Date(),
});
```

### File Validation
```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif'];

// Type check
if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) {
  setError('Invalid file type');
  return;
}

// Size check
if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
  setError('File too large');
  return;
}
```

---

## 🎯 User Profile Schema Update

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  photoURL?: string; // NEW: Profile picture URL from Firebase Storage
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

## 📊 Storage Costs (Estimate)

### Firebase Storage Pricing (Free Tier):
- **Storage**: 5GB free

- **Uploads**: 20,000/day free

### Typical Usage:
- **Average profile picture**: 500KB - 2MB
- **1,000 students**: ~1GB storage
- **Well within free tier**: ✅

### Production Estimates:
- **10,000 students** @ 1MB avg = ~10GB storage
- **Cost**: ~$0.026/GB/month = **$0.26/month**
- **Bandwidth**: Typically minimal for profile pics
