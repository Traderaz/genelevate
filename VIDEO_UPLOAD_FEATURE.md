```javascript
// Course Content (videos, images for lessons)
match /courses/{chapterId}/{lessonId}/{fileName} {
  // Public read for all authenticated users
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Content creators and admins can upload
  allow write: if request.auth != null 
               && (request.auth.token.role == 'admin' 
                   || request.auth.token.role == 'content-creator')
               && request.resource.size < 500 * 1024 * 1024; // Max 500MB
}

// Course Images
match /courses/{chapterId}/{lessonId}/images/{fileName} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null 
               && (request.auth.token.role == 'admin' 
                   || request.auth.token.role == 'content-creator')
               && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 // Max 5MB
               && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
}
```
