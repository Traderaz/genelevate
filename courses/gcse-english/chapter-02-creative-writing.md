# Chapter 2: Creative Writing

## Learning Objectives
- Write engaging descriptions and narratives
- Use language devices effectively
- Structure writing for impact
- Write with technical accuracy

## 2.1 Planning (5 minutes)

**ALWAYS plan before writing!**

**For descriptions:**
- Choose viewpoint (1st or 3rd person)
- Plan 5 senses
- Plan structure (zoom in/out, time progression)

**For narratives:**
- Plot outline
- Characters
- Setting
- Beginning/middle/end

## 2.2 Descriptive Writing

**Purpose:** Create vivid image for reader

**Techniques:**
- **Show, don't tell:** "Her hands trembled" not "She was nervous"
- **5 senses:** sight, sound, smell, taste, touch
- **Varied vocabulary:** Avoid repetition
- **Language devices:** Metaphors, similes, personification

**Example opening:**
"The abandoned house loomed before me, its broken windows like hollow eyes staring into my soul."

## 2.3 Narrative Writing

**Elements:**
- **Plot:** What happens
- **Characters:** Who it happens to
- **Setting:** Where/when
- **Dialogue:** What characters say
- **Action:** What characters do

**Structure:**
- **Beginning:** Hook, establish setting/character
- **Build-up:** Develop tension/conflict
- **Climax:** Peak of action/emotion
- **Resolution:** Tie up story

## 2.4 Language Techniques

**Ambitious vocabulary:**
- Use precise verbs (strolled, not walked)
- Strong adjectives (magnificent, not nice)
- Avoid clichés

**Sentence variety:**
- Simple: "The door opened."
- Compound: "The door opened and she entered."
- Complex: "As the door opened, she hesitated before entering."

**Paragraphing:**
- New paragraph for: new time, place, person, topic
- One-sentence paragraphs for impact

## 2.5 Openings and Endings

**Effective openings:**
- Action: "The gunshot echoed through the silent streets."
- Dialogue: "'Run!' she screamed."
- Description: "Rain hammered against the windows."
- Question: "What would you do?"

**Effective endings:**
- Resolution: Tie up story
- Cliffhanger: Leave reader wondering
- Circular: Link to beginning
- Reflection: Character realizes something

## 2.6 Technical Accuracy (AO6)

**Spelling, punctuation, grammar**

**Punctuation:**
- Full stops, commas, apostrophes
- Speech marks for dialogue
- Semicolons for effect

**Sentences:**
- Subject-verb agreement
