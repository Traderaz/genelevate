# Chapter 8: Comparing Texts

## Comparison Skills
1. **Identify:** What are texts about?
2. **Synthesize:** Find similar/different information
3. **Analyze:** How do writers achieve effects?
4. **Evaluate:** Which is more effective?

## Comparative Language
**Similarities:**
- "Both texts..."
- "Similarly..."
- "Likewise..."
- "In the same way..."

**Differences:**
- "In contrast..."
- "However..."
- "Whereas Text A..., Text B..."
- "Unlike..."
- "On the other hand..."

## Method
1. Read both texts
2. Identify main ideas
3. Find 2-3 comparison points
4. Use integrated structure (don't deal with texts separately)

## Example Paragraph
"Both writers describe urban environments, but their perspectives differ significantly. Writer A uses positive language, 'vibrant streets,' suggesting excitement, whereas Writer B employs negative imagery, 'oppressive concrete,' conveying a sense of claustrophobia."
