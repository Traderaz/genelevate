## 3.1 Solving Linear Equations

### Basic Principles

Whatever you do to one side, do to the other side!

**Example 1:** Solve x + 7 = 12

Solution:
- x + 7 − 7 = 12 − 7
- **x = 5**

**Example 2:** Solve 3x = 18

Solution:
- 3x ÷ 3 = 18 ÷ 3
- **x = 6**

**Example 3:** Solve 5x − 3 = 17

Solution:
- 5x − 3 + 3 = 17 + 3
- 5x = 20
- x = 20 ÷ 5
- **x = 4**

### Equations with Unknowns on Both Sides

**Example:** Solve 5x + 2 = 3x + 10

Solution:
- 5x + 2 − 3x = 3x + 10 − 3x (subtract 3x from both sides)
- 2x + 2 = 10
- 2x + 2 − 2 = 10 − 2 (subtract 2)
- 2x = 8
- x = 4
- **Answer: x = 4**

### Equations with Brackets

Expand brackets first, then solve:

**Example:** Solve 3(x + 2) = 18

Solution:
- 3x + 6 = 18
- 3x = 12
- **x = 4**

**Example:** Solve 2(3x − 5) = 4(x + 1)

Solution:
- 6x − 10 = 4x + 4
- 6x − 4x = 4 + 10
- 2x = 14
- **x = 7**

### Equations with Fractions

Method 1: Multiply through by the denominator

**Example:** Solve x/4 = 3

Solution:
- x/4 × 4 = 3 × 4
- **x = 12**

Method 2: Find a common denominator

**Example:** Solve x/2 + x/3 = 10

Solution:
- Multiply by 6: 3x + 2x = 60
- 5x = 60
- **x = 12**

---

## 3.2 Simultaneous Equations

Two equations with two unknowns, solved together.

### Elimination Method

**Example 1:** Solve:
- 3x + 2y = 16 ... ①
- 5x + 2y = 22 ... ②

Solution:
- Subtract ① from ②: 2x = 6
- x = 3
- Substitute into ①: 3(3) + 2y = 16
- 9 + 2y = 16
- 2y = 7
- y = 3.5
- **Answer: x = 3, y = 3.5**

**Example 2:** Solve:
- 2x + 3y = 12 ... ①
- 3x − 2y = 5 ... ②

Solution:
- Multiply ① by 2: 4x + 6y = 24 ... ③
- Multiply ② by 3: 9x − 6y = 15 ... ④
- Add ③ and ④: 13x = 39
- x = 3
- Substitute into ①: 2(3) + 3y = 12
- 6 + 3y = 12
- 3y = 6
- y = 2
- **Answer: x = 3, y = 2**

### Substitution Method

**Example:** Solve:
- y = 2x − 1 ... ①
- 3x + 4y = 18 ... ②

Solution:
- Substitute ① into ②: 3x + 4(2x − 1) = 18
- 3x + 8x − 4 = 18
- 11x = 22
- x = 2
- Substitute into ①: y = 2(2) − 1 = 3
- **Answer: x = 2, y = 3**

## 3.3 Quadratic Equations

Equations in the form ax² + bx + c = 0

### Solving by Factorising

**Example 1:** Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Solution:
- Factorise: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
- Either x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
- **x = −2 or x = −3**

**Example 2:** Solve x² − 7x + 12 = 0

Solution:
- (x − 3)(x − 4) = 0
- **x = 3 or x = 4**

**Example 3:** Solve x² = 4x

Solution:
- Rearrange: x² − 4x = 0
- Factorise: x(x − 4) = 0
- **x = 0 or x = 4**

### The Quadratic Formula (Higher Tier)

For ax² + bx + c = 0:

**x = [−b ± √(b² − 4ac)] / 2a**

**Example:** Solve 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0

Solution:
- a = 2, b = 7, c = 3
- x = [−7 ± √(49 − 24)] / 4
- x = [−7 ± √25] / 4
- x = [−7 ± 5] / 4
- x = −2/4 or x = −12/4
- **x = −0.5 or x = −3**

## 3.4 Inequalities

### Number Line Representation

- **<** means less than (open circle)
- **≤** means less than or equal to (closed circle)
- **>** means greater than (open circle)
- **≥** means greater than or equal to (closed circle)

**Example:** Represent x ≤ 3 on a number line

```
●━━━━━━━━━>
0  1  2  3  4
```

### Solving Inequalities

Solve like equations, BUT if you multiply or divide by a negative number, flip the inequality sign!

**Example 1:** Solve 3x + 5 ≤ 14

Solution:
- 3x ≤ 9
- **x ≤ 3**

**Example 2:** Solve 5 − 2x > 11

Solution:
- −2x > 6
- x < −3 (sign flips when dividing by −2)
- **x < −3**

**Example 3:** Solve −4 ≤ 2x < 6

Solution:
- Divide all parts by 2: −2 ≤ x < 3
- **Answer: −2 ≤ x < 3**

## 3.5 Forming Equations

### Word Problems

**Example 1:** The sum of three consecutive numbers is 54. Find the numbers.

Solution:
- Let the numbers be n, n + 1, n + 2
- n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 54
- 3n + 3 = 54
- 3n = 51
- n = 17
- **Numbers are 17, 18, 19**

**Example 2:** A rectangle has length (2x + 3) cm and width (x − 1) cm. Its perimeter is 28 cm. Find x.

Solution:
- Perimeter = 2(length + width)
- 2[(2x + 3) + (x − 1)] = 28
- 2[3x + 2] = 28
- 6x + 4 = 28
- 6x = 24
- **x = 4**

## Key Points to Remember

✓ Whatever you do to one side, do to the other
✓ When solving inequalities, flip the sign if multiplying/dividing by negative
✓ For simultaneous equations: make coefficients the same, then add or subtract
✓ For quadratics: factorise and set each bracket equal to zero
✓ Check your answers by substituting back into the original equation
