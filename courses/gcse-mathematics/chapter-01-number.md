## 1.1 Place Value and Ordering

### Understanding Place Value

Every digit in a number has a place value based on its position:

| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|-----------|----------|------|------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
| 1000      | 100      | 10   | 1    |   | 0.1    | 0.01       | 0.001       |

**Example:** In the number 3,456.78:
- 3 is worth 3,000 (3 thousands)
- 4 is worth 400 (4 hundreds)
- 5 is worth 50 (5 tens)
- 6 is worth 6 (6 ones)
- 7 is worth 0.7 (7 tenths)
- 8 is worth 0.08 (8 hundredths)

### Ordering Numbers

To order numbers:
1. Compare digits from left to right
2. Start with the highest place value
3. Use < (less than) and > (greater than) symbols

**Example:** Order these numbers: 4.56, 4.6, 4.065, 4.5

Answer: 4.065 < 4.5 < 4.56 < 4.6

## 1.2 Operations with Numbers

### BIDMAS/BODMAS Order of Operations

**B**rackets → **I**ndices/Orders → **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left to right) → **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

**Example:** Calculate 5 + 3 × 2²

Solution:
1. Indices first: 2² = 4
2. Then multiplication: 3 × 4 = 12
3. Finally addition: 5 + 12 = 17

**Answer: 17**

### Working with Negative Numbers

**Rules for multiplying and dividing:**
- Same signs → positive result (+×+ = +, −×− = +)
- Different signs → negative result (+×− = −, −×+ = −)

**Examples:**
- 6 × (−3) = −18
- (−4) × (−5) = 20
- (−12) ÷ (−3) = 4
- 20 ÷ (−5) = −4

## 1.3 Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

### Converting Between Forms

| Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 1/2      | 0.5     | 50%        |
| 1/4      | 0.25    | 25%        |
| 3/4      | 0.75    | 75%        |
| 1/5      | 0.2     | 20%        |
| 1/10     | 0.1     | 10%        |

**Conversion methods:**
- Fraction → Decimal: Divide numerator by denominator
- Decimal → Percentage: Multiply by 100
- Percentage → Fraction: Write over 100 and simplify

**Example:** Convert 3/8 to a decimal and percentage

Solution:
- 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375 (decimal)
- 0.375 × 100 = 37.5% (percentage)

### Operations with Fractions

**Adding/Subtracting:** Find common denominator
- 1/3 + 1/4 = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

**Multiplying:** Multiply numerators, multiply denominators
- 2/3 × 3/5 = 6/15 = 2/5

**Dividing:** Multiply by the reciprocal (flip the second fraction)
- 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9

---

## 1.4 Standard Form

Standard form (or scientific notation) expresses numbers as **a × 10ⁿ** where 1 ≤ a < 10

### Writing Numbers in Standard Form

**Large numbers:**
- 45,000 = 4.5 × 10⁴
- 3,200,000 = 3.2 × 10⁶

**Small numbers:**
- 0.0067 = 6.7 × 10⁻³
- 0.000052 = 5.2 × 10⁻⁵

### Calculations in Standard Form

**Example:** Calculate (3 × 10⁵) × (2 × 10³)

Solution:
- Multiply the numbers: 3 × 2 = 6
- Add the powers: 10⁵ × 10³ = 10⁸
- Answer: 6 × 10⁸

**Example:** Calculate (8 × 10⁶) ÷ (2 × 10²)

Solution:
- Divide the numbers: 8 ÷ 2 = 4
- Subtract the powers: 10⁶ ÷ 10² = 10⁴
- Answer: 4 × 10⁴

---

## 1.5 Estimation and Approximation

### Rounding Rules

**Rounding to decimal places (d.p.):**
- Look at the digit one place further
- If 5 or more, round up; if less than 5, round down

**Example:** Round 4.5678 to 2 d.p.
- Look at third decimal place: 7
- 7 ≥ 5, so round up
- Answer: 4.57

**Rounding to significant figures (s.f.):**
- Start counting from the first non-zero digit
- Apply same rounding rules

**Example:** Round 0.004567 to 2 s.f.
- First non-zero digit is 4
- Count two places: 4.5
- Look at next digit: 6
- Answer: 0.0046

### Estimation

Round numbers to 1 significant figure to estimate calculations:

**Example:** Estimate 49.3 × 5.87

Solution:
- Round 49.3 ≈ 50
- Round 5.87 ≈ 6
- Estimate: 50 × 6 = 300
- (Actual answer: 289.391)

## 1.6 Factors, Multiples, and Primes

### Key Definitions

**Factor:** A number that divides exactly into another number
- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

**Multiple:** The result of multiplying a number by an integer
- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...

**Prime number:** A number with exactly two factors (1 and itself)
- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23...
- Note: 1 is NOT prime (only has one factor)

### Highest Common Factor (HCF)

The largest number that divides into two or more numbers.

**Example:** Find the HCF of 24 and 36

Method 1 - List factors:
- Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
- Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
- Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- **HCF = 12**

Method 2 - Prime factorization:
- 24 = 2³ × 3
- 36 = 2² × 3²
- HCF = 2² × 3 = 12

### Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)

The smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.

**Example:** Find the LCM of 6 and 8

Method 1 - List multiples:
- Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...
- Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32...
- **LCM = 24**

Method 2 - Prime factorization:
- 6 = 2 × 3
- 8 = 2³
- LCM = 2³ × 3 = 24

### Prime Factorization

Express a number as a product of prime numbers.

**Example:** Write 60 as a product of prime factors

Using a factor tree:
```
       60
      /  \
    2     30
         /  \
        2    15
            /  \
           3    5
```

**60 = 2² × 3 × 5**
