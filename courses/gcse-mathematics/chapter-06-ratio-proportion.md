## 6.1 Simplifying Ratios

### Basic Ratio Rules

Ratios compare quantities. Write as **a:b** or **a/b**

To simplify: divide both sides by their HCF

**Example 1:** Simplify 12:18

Solution:
- HCF of 12 and 18 is 6
- 12 ÷ 6 : 18 ÷ 6
- **Answer: 2:3**

**Example 2:** Simplify 24:36:48

Solution:
- HCF is 12
- 24:36:48 = **2:3:4**

### Equivalent Ratios

Like fractions, ratios can be equivalent:

- 1:2 = 2:4 = 3:6 = 5:10

**Example:** Write 3:5 in the form n:1

Solution:
- 3:5 = 3/5 : 1
- **0.6:1**

---

## 6.2 Sharing in Ratios

### Dividing Quantities

**Example 1:** Share £60 in the ratio 2:3

Solution:
- Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5
- Each part = £60 ÷ 5 = £12
- First share: 2 × £12 = **£24**
- Second share: 3 × £12 = **£36**
- Check: £24 + £36 = £60 ✓

**Example 2:** Divide 450g in the ratio 2:3:4

Solution:
- Total parts = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
- Each part = 450 ÷ 9 = 50g
- Shares: **100g : 150g : 200g**

### Ratio Problems

**Example:** Alex and Ben share sweets in ratio 3:5. Ben gets 20 sweets. How many does Alex get?

Solution:
- Ben's share = 5 parts = 20
- 1 part = 20 ÷ 5 = 4
- Alex's share = 3 × 4 = **12 sweets**

---

## 6.3 Direct Proportion

When one quantity increases, the other increases proportionally.

Symbol: ∝ (proportional to)

**Example 1:** 5 pencils cost £2. How much do 8 pencils cost?

Solution:
- Cost ∝ number of pencils
- 1 pencil = £2 ÷ 5 = £0.40
- 8 pencils = 8 × £0.40 = **£3.20**

**Example 2:** A recipe for 4 people needs 200g flour. How much for 10 people?

Solution:
- Flour per person = 200 ÷ 4 = 50g
- For 10 people = 10 × 50 = **500g**

### Using the Unitary Method

1. Find the value for ONE unit
2. Multiply by required number of units

---

## 6.4 Inverse Proportion

When one quantity increases, the other decreases proportionally.

**Example:** 6 workers take 10 days to complete a job. How long would 15 workers take?

Solution:
- Total work = 6 × 10 = 60 worker-days
- Time for 15 workers = 60 ÷ 15 = **4 days**

**General rule:** If xy = k (constant), then x and y are inversely proportional.

## 6.5 Percentages

### Basic Percentage Calculations

**To find a percentage of an amount:**

**Example:** Find 15% of £60

Method 1: Use calculator
- 15% = 0.15
- 0.15 × 60 = **£9**

Method 2: Find 1%, then multiply
- 1% = £60 ÷ 100 = £0.60
- 15% = 15 × £0.60 = **£9**

### Percentage Increase and Decrease

**Example 1:** Increase £50 by 20%

Solution:
- 20% of £50 = 0.2 × 50 = £10
- New amount = £50 + £10 = **£60**

OR: Multiplier = 1.20
- £50 × 1.20 = **£60**

**Example 2:** Decrease 80 kg by 15%

Solution:
- Multiplier = 1 − 0.15 = 0.85
- 80 × 0.85 = **68 kg**

### Percentage Change

**Formula:** (Change ÷ Original) × 100

**Example:** A price increases from £20 to £25. Find the percentage increase.

Solution:
- Change = £25 − £20 = £5
- Percentage = (5 ÷ 20) × 100 = **25%**

### Reverse Percentages

Finding the original value after a percentage change.

**Example:** After a 20% increase, a price is £72. Find the original price.

Solution:
- 120% = £72
- 1% = £72 ÷ 120 = £0.60
- 100% = 100 × £0.60 = **£60**

OR: Original = £72 ÷ 1.20 = **£60**

---

## 6.6 Compound Measures

### Speed

**Speed = Distance ÷ Time**

Units: m/s, km/h, mph

**Example:** A car travels 150 miles in 2.5 hours. Find its average speed.

Solution:
- Speed = 150 ÷ 2.5 = **60 mph**

**Triangle method:**
```
    D
   ─────
   S × T
```
- D = S × T
- S = D ÷ T
- T = D ÷ S

### Density

**Density = Mass ÷ Volume**

Units: g/cm³, kg/m³

**Example:** A block of metal has mass 200g and volume 25 cm³. Find its density.

Solution:
- Density = 200 ÷ 25 = **8 g/cm³**

### Other Compound Measures

- **Pressure** = Force ÷ Area (N/m² or Pa)
- **Rate** = Quantity ÷ Time
- **Population density** = Population ÷ Area

---

## 6.7 Scale Factors and Maps

### Maps and Scale Drawings

**Example:** On a map, 1 cm represents 5 km. Two towns are 3.5 cm apart on the map. Find the real distance.

Solution:
- Real distance = 3.5 × 5 = **17.5 km**

### Enlargement

**Linear scale factor:** Multiplies lengths

**Example:** A rectangle 4 cm × 3 cm is enlarged by scale factor 3.
- New dimensions: **12 cm × 9 cm**

**Area scale factor:** (Linear SF)²
- Original area = 12 cm²
- New area = 12 × 3² = 12 × 9 = **108 cm²**

**Volume scale factor:** (Linear SF)³
- If linear SF = 2, volume SF = 2³ = **8**

## Key Points to Remember

✓ To simplify ratios, divide by the HCF
✓ When sharing in ratios: find total parts, find value of one part, multiply
✓ Percentage multipliers: increase by 20% = ×1.20, decrease by 15% = ×0.85
✓ Speed = Distance ÷ Time
✓ For reverse percentages, divide by the multiplier
✓ Linear SF of k gives area SF of k² and volume SF of k³
