## 4.1 Coordinates

### The Coordinate System

Points are written as (x, y):
- **x-coordinate:** horizontal distance from origin
- **y-coordinate:** vertical distance from origin

```
    y
    |
  2 |     B(3,2)
    |
  0 |___________x
   -2  0   3
```

**Four Quadrants:**
- Quadrant 1: (+, +) top right
- Quadrant 2: (−, +) top left
- Quadrant 3: (−, −) bottom left
- Quadrant 4: (+, −) bottom right

---

## 4.2 Linear Graphs

### y = mx + c Form

- **m** is the gradient (steepness)
- **c** is the y-intercept (where it crosses the y-axis)

**Example:** y = 2x + 3
- Gradient (m) = 2
- Y-intercept (c) = 3

### Finding the Gradient

Gradient = change in y / change in x = rise / run

**Example:** Find the gradient between (1, 2) and (5, 10)

Solution:
- Change in y = 10 − 2 = 8
- Change in x = 5 − 1 = 4
- Gradient = 8/4 = **2**

### Drawing Linear Graphs

Method: Use a table of values

**Example:** Draw y = 2x − 1

| x  | -1 | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| y  | -3 | -1 | 1  | 3  | 5  |

Plot the points and draw a straight line through them.

### Finding the Equation of a Line

**Example:** Find the equation of the line passing through (0, 5) with gradient 3

Solution:
- c = 5 (y-intercept)
- m = 3 (gradient)
- **y = 3x + 5**

**Example:** Find the equation of the line through (1, 4) and (3, 10)

Solution:
- Gradient: (10 − 4)/(3 − 1) = 6/2 = 3
- Use y = mx + c: 4 = 3(1) + c
- c = 1
- **y = 3x + 1**

---

## 4.3 Quadratic Graphs

Shape: **Parabola** (U-shaped or ∩-shaped)

Form: y = ax² + bx + c

**Key Features:**
- If a > 0: U-shape (smiles)
- If a < 0: ∩-shape (frowns)
- Turning point (vertex): minimum or maximum
- Line of symmetry: vertical line through turning point

**Example:** Draw y = x² − 4x + 3

| x  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| y  | 3  | 0  | -1 | 0  | 3  |

Turning point at (2, −1)

---

## 4.4 Other Graphs

### Cubic Graphs

Form: y = ax³ + bx² + cx + d

Shape: S-curve

**Example:** y = x³

| x  | -2 | -1 | 0  | 1  | 2  |
|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| y  | -8 | -1 | 0  | 1  | 8  |

### Reciprocal Graphs

Form: y = k/x

Shape: Two curved branches (hyperbola)

**Example:** y = 1/x

| x  | -2  | -1  | -0.5| 0.5 | 1   | 2   |
|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| y  | -0.5| -1  | -2  | 2   | 1   | 0.5 |

**Key features:**
- Never touches axes (asymptotes at x = 0 and y = 0)
- Two separate branches

---

## 4.5 Real-Life Graphs

### Distance-Time Graphs

- **Gradient** = speed
- **Flat line** = stationary (not moving)
- **Steeper line** = faster speed

**Example:** Interpret this distance-time graph:

```
Distance
   |     /‾‾‾
   |    /
   |   /
   |__/________Time
   0  2  4  6
```

- 0-2 mins: travelling (constant speed)
- 2-4 mins: stationary
- 4-6 mins: travelling faster (steeper gradient)

### Speed-Time Graphs

- **Gradient** = acceleration
- **Flat line** = constant speed
- **Area under graph** = distance travelled

**Example:** Calculate distance from speed-time graph:

If constant speed of 20 m/s for 5 seconds:
- Distance = 20 × 5 = **100 m**

---

## 4.6 Graph Transformations (Higher Tier)

### Translations

- **y = f(x) + a**: shift up by a units
- **y = f(x) − a**: shift down by a units
- **y = f(x + a)**: shift left by a units
- **y = f(x − a)**: shift right by a units

**Example:** If f(x) = x², describe the transformation of f(x) + 3

Answer: Translation 3 units up

### Reflections

- **y = −f(x)**: reflection in x-axis
- **y = f(−x)**: reflection in y-axis

**Example:** y = −x² is x² reflected in the x-axis

### Stretches

- **y = af(x)**: vertical stretch, scale factor a
- **y = f(ax)**: horizontal stretch, scale factor 1/a

## Key Points to Remember

✓ y = mx + c: m is gradient, c is y-intercept
✓ Gradient = rise/run = change in y / change in x
✓ Quadratic graphs are U-shaped (parabolas)
✓ On distance-time graphs, gradient = speed
✓ On speed-time graphs, gradient = acceleration and area = distance
✓ Graph transformations: +/− outside affects y, inside affects x
