## 5.1 Angle Properties

### Basic Angle Facts

**Angles on a straight line:** Sum to 180°
```
    a    b
────●────●────
```
a + b = 180°

**Angles around a point:** Sum to 360°
```
      a
    ╱ | ╲
   b  ●  c
```
a + b + c = 360°

**Vertically opposite angles:** Equal
```
    a╲  ╱b
      ╲╱
      ╱╲
    c╱  ╲d
```
a = b and c = d

## 5.2 Angles in Parallel Lines

When a transversal crosses parallel lines:

**Alternate angles** (Z-shape): Equal
```
    ╱ a
───╱──────
  ╱
─╱────────
╱ b
```
a = b

**Corresponding angles** (F-shape): Equal
```
    ╱ a
───╱──────
  ╱ b
─╱────────
```
a = b

**Co-interior angles** (C-shape): Sum to 180°
```
    ╱ a
───╱──────
  ╱
─╱────────
  ╲ b
```
a + b = 180°

## 5.3 Angles in Triangles and Quadrilaterals

### Triangles

**Angle sum:** 180°

**Example:** Find angle x in a triangle with angles 65° and 80°

Solution: x = 180° − 65° − 80° = **35°**

**Types of triangles:**
- **Equilateral:** 3 equal sides, 3 equal angles (60° each)
- **Isosceles:** 2 equal sides, 2 equal angles
- **Right-angled:** One 90° angle

### Quadrilaterals

**Angle sum:** 360°

**Properties:**
- **Square:** 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
- **Rectangle:** Opposite sides equal, 4 right angles
- **Parallelogram:** Opposite sides parallel and equal
- **Rhombus:** 4 equal sides, opposite angles equal
- **Trapezium:** One pair of parallel sides
- **Kite:** 2 pairs of adjacent sides equal

## 5.4 Polygons

### Interior and Exterior Angles

For a polygon with **n** sides:

**Sum of interior angles:** (n − 2) × 180°
**Each interior angle (regular):** [(n − 2) × 180°] ÷ n

**Sum of exterior angles:** Always 360°
**Each exterior angle (regular):** 360° ÷ n

**Example:** Find each interior angle of a regular hexagon (6 sides)

Solution:
- Sum = (6 − 2) × 180° = 720°
- Each angle = 720° ÷ 6 = **120°**

---

## 5.5 Circle Theorems (Higher Tier)

1. **Angle in a semicircle = 90°**
2. **Angles in the same segment are equal**
3. **Angle at centre = 2 × angle at circumference**
4. **Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180°**
5. **Tangent perpendicular to radius**
6. **Two tangents from a point are equal length**
7. **Alternate segment theorem**

---

## 5.6 Perimeter and Area

### Rectangles

- **Perimeter** = 2(length + width)
- **Area** = length × width

**Example:** Rectangle 8 cm × 5 cm
- Perimeter = 2(8 + 5) = **26 cm**
- Area = 8 × 5 = **40 cm²**

### Triangles

- **Area** = ½ × base × height

**Example:** Triangle with base 10 cm and height 6 cm
- Area = ½ × 10 × 6 = **30 cm²**

### Parallelograms

- **Area** = base × perpendicular height

### Trapeziums

- **Area** = ½(a + b)h
  - a and b are parallel sides
  - h is perpendicular height

**Example:** Trapezium with parallel sides 8 cm and 12 cm, height 5 cm
- Area = ½(8 + 12) × 5 = ½ × 20 × 5 = **50 cm²**

---

## 5.7 Circles

### Circle Formulas

- **Circumference** = πd = 2πr
- **Area** = πr²

Where r = radius, d = diameter

**Example 1:** Circle with radius 7 cm (use π = 22/7)

- Circumference = 2 × 22/7 × 7 = **44 cm**
- Area = 22/7 × 7² = 22/7 × 49 = **154 cm²**

**Example 2:** Circle with diameter 10 cm (use π = 3.14)

- Radius = 5 cm
- Circumference = 3.14 × 10 = **31.4 cm**
- Area = 3.14 × 5² = 3.14 × 25 = **78.5 cm²**

### Sectors and Arcs

**Arc length** = (θ/360) × 2πr
**Sector area** = (θ/360) × πr²

Where θ is the angle at centre

**Example:** Sector with radius 6 cm and angle 60°

- Arc length = 60/360 × 2π × 6 = 1/6 × 12π = **2π cm** ≈ 6.28 cm
- Sector area = 60/360 × π × 36 = 1/6 × 36π = **6π cm²** ≈ 18.85 cm²

---

## 5.8 Volume and Surface Area

### Cuboids

- **Volume** = length × width × height
- **Surface area** = 2(lw + lh + wh)

**Example:** Cuboid 5 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm

- Volume = 5 × 4 × 3 = **60 cm³**
- Surface area = 2(20 + 15 + 12) = 2 × 47 = **94 cm²**

### Prisms

A prism has a constant cross-section.

- **Volume** = cross-sectional area × length

**Example:** Triangular prism with triangular face area 12 cm² and length 10 cm

- Volume = 12 × 10 = **120 cm³**

### Cylinders

- **Volume** = πr²h
- **Curved surface area** = 2πrh
- **Total surface area** = 2πrh + 2πr²

**Example:** Cylinder with radius 3 cm and height 10 cm

- Volume = π × 3² × 10 = 90π = **283 cm³** (to 3 s.f.)
- Curved SA = 2π × 3 × 10 = 60π = **189 cm²** (to 3 s.f.)

### Spheres

- **Volume** = (4/3)πr³
- **Surface area** = 4πr²

### Cones and Pyramids

- **Volume** = (1/3) × base area × height
- **Cone curved SA** = πrl (where l is slant height)

## 5.9 Plans and Elevations

Three views of a 3D object:
- **Plan:** View from above
- **Front elevation:** View from front
- **Side elevation:** View from side

**Example:** For a cylinder standing upright:
- Plan: Circle
- Front elevation: Rectangle
- Side elevation: Rectangle

## 5.10 Constructions

### Using Ruler and Compasses

1. **Perpendicular bisector:** Bisects a line at 90°
2. **Angle bisector:** Divides an angle in half
3. **Perpendicular from a point**
4. **60° angle:** Using equilateral triangle

### Loci (Higher Tier)

**Locus** = path of points following a rule

Common loci:
- Fixed distance from a point: **Circle**
- Fixed distance from a line: **Parallel lines**
- Equidistant from two points: **Perpendicular bisector**
- Equidistant from two lines: **Angle bisector**
