## 2.8 Limited vs Unlimited Liability

### Unlimited Liability

- Personal assets (house, car, savings) can be seized
- Owner liable for all debts, even if exceeds business assets
- Higher personal risk

### Limited Liability

**Definition**: Owner's responsibility for debts limited to amount invested in business

**Applies to**:
- Private Limited Companies (Ltd)
- Public Limited Companies (PLC)
- Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP)

**Implications**:

- Only lose investment in shares
- Lower personal risk

**Example**: If an Ltd company owes £100,000 and goes bankrupt, shareholders only lose their share investment. Personal assets are safe.

### Comparison

|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Personal Risk** | High - all assets at risk | Low - only investment at risk |
| **Responsibility** | Full liability for debts | Limited to share value |
| **Setup** | Simple and cheap | More complex and costly |
