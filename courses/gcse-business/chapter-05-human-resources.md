### Motivation Theories

#### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

**Theory**: People are motivated by five levels of needs, starting with basic needs

```
Level 5: Self-Actualization (achieving full potential)
Level 4: Esteem Needs (recognition, respect, achievement)
Level 3: Social Needs (belonging, teamwork, relationships)
Level 2: Safety Needs (job security, safe working conditions)
Level 1: Physiological Needs (fair wage for food, shelter)
```

**Application in Business**:
- **Level 1**: Living wage
- **Level 2**: Employment contract, health & safety
- **Level 3**: Team building, social events
- **Level 4**: Promotions, employee recognition
- **Level 5**: Challenging work, autonomy

**Limitation**: Not everyone follows hierarchy in same order; some prioritize esteem over social needs.

#### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

**Theory**: Two types of factors affect motivation

**Hygiene Factors** (Prevent dissatisfaction, don't motivate):
- Pay and benefits
- Working conditions
- Company policies
- Job security
- Relationship with supervisor

**Motivators** (Create satisfaction and motivation):
- Achievement
- Recognition
- Responsibility
- Advancement
- The work itself
- Personal growth

**Application**: Businesses must ensure hygiene factors are adequate, then focus on motivators for real motivation.

**Example**: Paying fair wages prevents dissatisfaction, but giving employees challenging projects and recognition truly motivates them.

**Key principles**:
- Analyze tasks to find most efficient method
