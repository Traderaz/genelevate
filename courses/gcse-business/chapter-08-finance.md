## 8.3 Financial Ratios

### Profitability Ratios

#### Gross Profit Margin

**Formula**: (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100

**Example**:
- Gross Profit: £200,000
- Revenue: £500,000
- GPM = (£200,000 ÷ £500,000) × 100 = 40%

**Interpretation**: For every £1 of sales, business makes 40p gross profit

**Ways to improve**:
- Increase selling prices
- Reduce cost of sales (negotiate supplier discounts)
- More efficient production

#### Operating Profit Margin

**Formula**: (Operating Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100

**Example**:
- Operating Profit: £80,000
- Revenue: £500,000
- OPM = (£80,000 ÷ £500,000) × 100 = 16%

**Interpretation**: For every £1 of sales, business makes 16p operating profit

**Ways to improve**:
- Increase sales
- Reduce operating expenses (rent, wages, marketing)
- Improve efficiency

#### Net Profit Margin (Profit for the Year Margin)

**Formula**: (Profit for the Year ÷ Revenue) × 100

**Example**:
- Profit for the Year: £56,000
- Revenue: £500,000
- NPM = (£56,000 ÷ £500,000) × 100 = 11.2%

**Interpretation**: For every £1 of sales, business makes 11.2p final profit

### Liquidity Ratios

**Liquidity** = Ability to pay short-term debts

#### Current Ratio

**Formula**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

**Example**:
- Current Assets: £90,000
- Current Liabilities: £35,000
- Current Ratio = £90,000 ÷ £35,000 = 2.57:1

**Interpretation**:
- **2:1 is ideal**: £2 of current assets for every £1 of current liabilities
- **Below 1:1**: Liquidity problems (can't pay short-term debts)
- **Above 3:1**: Too much cash sitting idle

#### Acid Test Ratio (Quick Ratio)

**Formula**: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities

**Example**:
- Current Assets: £90,000
- Inventory: £40,000
- Current Liabilities: £35,000
- Acid Test = (£90,000 - £40,000) ÷ £35,000 = 1.43:1

**Interpretation**:
- More stringent than current ratio
- Excludes inventory (takes time to sell)
- **1:1 is ideal**: £1 of liquid assets for every £1 of current liabilities

**Ways to improve liquidity**:
- Chase late-paying customers
- Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers
- Reduce inventory levels
- Arrange overdraft facility
- Sell unused assets

### Other Important Ratios

#### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

**Formula**: (Operating Profit ÷ Capital Employed) × 100

**Interpretation**: Efficiency of capital investment

#### Gearing Ratio

**Formula**: (Non-Current Liabilities ÷ Capital Employed) × 100

**Interpretation**:
- Measures reliance on borrowed money
- High gearing (>50%) = high risk

## 8.4 Cash Flow

### Cash vs Profit

**Key difference**: Can be profitable but still run out of cash!

| Cash | Profit |
|------|--------|
| Money in bank | Revenue - Costs |
| Actual inflows/outflows | Accounting concept |
| Timing matters | Period measurement |
| Survival essential | Long-term success |

**Example**: Sell £100,000 of goods (profit) but customer pays in 90 days (no cash yet)

### Cash Flow Forecast

**Purpose**: Predict future cash inflows and outflows

**Structure**:
```
                        Jan      Feb      Mar
CASH INFLOWS
Sales Revenue        50,000   60,000   55,000
Capital Introduced   10,000        -        -
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Inflows        60,000   60,000   55,000

CASH OUTFLOWS
Purchases            20,000   25,000   22,000
Wages                15,000   15,000   15,000
Rent                  5,000    5,000    5,000
Marketing             3,000    4,000    3,500
Equipment            20,000        -        -
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Outflows       63,000   49,000   45,500

NET CASH FLOW        (3,000)  11,000    9,500

Opening Balance       5,000    2,000   13,000
Closing Balance       2,000   13,000   22,500
```

**Benefits of Cash Flow Forecasts**:
✓ Identify potential shortages  
✓ Plan timing of receipts/payments  
✓ Support loan applications  
✓ Make informed decisions

**Causes of Cash Flow Problems**:
- Overtrading (growing too fast)
- Poor credit control (late payers)
- Seasonal variations
- Unexpected costs
- Low sales
- Too much inventory

**Solutions**:
- Arrange overdraft
- Chase debtors
- Negotiate extended credit with suppliers
- Lease rather than buy equipment
- Reduce inventory
- Delay capital expenditure

## 8.5 Break-Even Analysis

### Break-Even Point

**Definition**: Sales level where total revenue equals total costs (no profit, no loss)

### Key Terms

- **Fixed Costs**: Costs that don't change with output (rent, salaries, insurance)
- **Variable Costs**: Costs that change with output (materials, packaging)
- **Total Costs**: Fixed Costs + Variable Costs
- **Revenue**: Selling Price × Quantity Sold
- **Contribution**: Selling Price - Variable Cost per Unit

### Break-Even Formula

**Break-Even Point (units)** = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution per Unit

**Example**:
- Fixed Costs: £20,000
- Selling Price per unit: £50
- Variable Cost per unit: £30
- Contribution per unit: £50 - £30 = £20

**Break-Even** = £20,000 ÷ £20 = **1,000 units**

### Break-Even Chart

Total Costs (Fixed + Variable)
```

### Margin of Safety

**Definition**: Difference between actual sales and break-even sales

**Formula**: Actual Sales - Break-Even Sales

**Example**:
- Actual sales: 1,500 units
- Break-even: 1,000 units
- Margin of Safety: 500 units (or 33%)

**Interpretation**: Sales can fall by 500 units before making a loss

### Using Break-Even Analysis

**Benefits**:
✓ Identify minimum sales needed  
✓ Inform pricing decisions  
✓ Evaluate impact of cost changes  
✓ Support loan applications  
✓ Plan for different scenarios

**Limitations**:
❌ Assumes all units sold  
❌ Assumes constant selling price  
❌ Assumes constant variable cost  
❌ Ignores bulk discounts  
❌ Only works for single product

## 8.6 Budgets

### What is a Budget?

**Budget** = Financial plan for future period

### Types of Budgets

1. **Sales Budget**: Expected sales revenue
2. **Production Budget**: Expected production costs
3. **Marketing Budget**: Planned marketing expenditure
4. **Cash Budget**: Expected cash inflows/outflows

### Benefits of Budgets

✓ Control spending  
✓ Set targets  
✓ Motivate staff  
✓ Coordinate departments  
✓ Identify problems early  
✓ Measure performance

### Variance Analysis

**Variance** = Difference between budgeted and actual figures

| Variance Type | Calculation | Good/Bad |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Favorable Revenue** | Actual > Budget | Good ✓ |
| **Adverse Revenue** | Actual < Budget | Bad ❌ |
| **Favorable Cost** | Actual < Budget | Good ✓ |
| **Adverse Cost** | Actual > Budget | Bad ❌ |

**Example**:
```
           Budget   Actual  Variance
Revenue    £50,000  £52,000  £2,000 Favorable
Costs      £30,000  £32,000  £2,000 Adverse
Profit     £20,000  £20,000  Break-even
```

### Zero-Based Budgeting

**Definition**: Each department must justify entire budget from zero (rather than previous year + increase)

**Advantages**:
✓ Questions all spending  
✓ Identifies waste  
✓ Forces priorities

**Disadvantages**:
❌ Time-consuming  
❌ Demotivating for managers
