# Chapter 8: Space Physics (Higher Tier)

## Learning Objectives
- Describe our solar system
- Explain the life cycle of stars
- Understand red-shift and the expanding universe
- Evaluate evidence for the Big Bang theory

## 8.1 Our Solar System

**Components:**
- Sun (star at center)
- 8 planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
- Dwarf planets (Pluto, Ceres)
- Moons (natural satellites)
- Asteroids, comets

**Orbit:**
- Planets orbit Sun in ellipses
- Gravitational force provides centripetal force
- Closer to Sun → faster orbital speed

## 8.2 Formation of Solar System

**Nebula → Protostar → Star + Planets**

1. Cloud of dust and gas (nebula)
2. Gravity pulls matter together
3. Forms protostar (gets hotter)
4. Nuclear fusion begins → main sequence star
5. Remaining matter forms planets

## 8.3 Life Cycle of Stars

**Main sequence star (like Sun):**
- Hydrogen fuses to helium
- Outward pressure (fusion) = Inward pressure (gravity)
- Stable for billions of years

**Low mass stars (like Sun):**
Main sequence → Red giant → White dwarf → Black dwarf

**High mass stars:**
Main sequence → Red super giant → Supernova → Neutron star OR Black hole

## 8.4 Fusion in Stars

**Process:** Small nuclei join to form larger nuclei, releasing energy

**In main sequence:**
Hydrogen → Helium

**In red giants:**
Helium → heavier elements (up to iron)

**In supernovae:**
Elements heavier than iron formed
These elements scattered into space

**Important:** All elements except hydrogen formed in stars!

## 8.5 Orbital Motion

**Centripetal force:** Force towards center keeping object in circular motion

**For planets:**
- Gravitational force provides centripetal force
- Closer orbit → greater speed

**For satellites:**
- Low orbit → faster, shorter period
- High orbit (geostationary) → slower, 24-hour period

## 8.6 Red-Shift

**Observation:** Light from distant galaxies is shifted towards red end of spectrum

**Explanation:** Galaxies moving away from us
- Wavelength increases (stretches)
- Frequency decreases

**Doppler effect:**
- Moving away → red-shift (longer wavelength)
- Moving towards → blue-shift (shorter wavelength)

**Greater red-shift = faster recession**

## 8.7 The Expanding Universe

**Evidence:** Nearly all galaxies show red-shift
**Conclusion:** Universe is expanding

**The further the galaxy, the greater the red-shift**
**This means:** More distant galaxies moving away faster

**Implications:**
- Universe started from single point
- Supports Big Bang theory

## 8.8 The Big Bang Theory

**Theory:** Universe began ~13.8 billion years ago from single point

**Evidence:**
1. **Red-shift:** Universe expanding
2. **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR):** Detected everywhere, remnant of Big Bang
3. **Abundance of hydrogen and helium**

**Timeline:**
1. Big Bang (extremely hot, dense point)
2. Rapid expansion and cooling
3. Atoms formed
4. Stars and galaxies formed
5. Continues expanding today

## 8.9 The Fate of the Universe

**Possible futures:**

**1. Continuous expansion:**
- If expansion continues
- Universe becomes cold and dark

**2. Big Crunch:**
- If gravity strong enough
- Expansion stops, universe contracts
- Collapses back to single point

**Current evidence:** Expansion is accelerating (dark energy)

## 8.10 Solar System Exploration

**Methods:**
- Telescopes (optical, radio)
- Space probes (unmanned)
- Landers and rovers
- Manned missions

**Challenges:**
- Vast distances
- Extreme temperatures
- Radiation
- Cost
- Communication delays
