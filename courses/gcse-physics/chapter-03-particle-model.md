# Chapter 3: Particle Model of Matter

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the particle model and states of matter
- Calculate density
- Explain changes of state and internal energy
- Use specific heat capacity and latent heat

## 3.1 States of Matter

**Three states:**

**Solid:**
- Particles close together, regular arrangement
- Strong forces, vibrate in fixed positions
- Fixed shape and volume

**Liquid:**
- Particles close together, random arrangement
- Weaker forces, can move past each other
- Fixed volume, takes shape of container

**Gas:**
- Particles far apart, random arrangement
- Very weak forces, move freely and quickly
- No fixed shape or volume, fills container

## 3.2 Changes of State

**State changes:**
- Melting: Solid → Liquid
- Freezing: Liquid → Solid
- Boiling/Evaporation: Liquid → Gas
- Condensing: Gas → Liquid
- Sublimation: Solid → Gas

**Physical changes:**
- No new substance formed
- Mass conserved
- Reversible

## 3.3 Density

**Density = Mass / Volume**
ρ = m/V

Units: kg/m³ or g/cm³

**Example:** 200g block, volume 50 cm³
- Density = 200/50 = **4 g/cm³**

**Required Practical:** Measuring density of regular and irregular objects

## 3.4 Internal Energy

**Definition:** Total kinetic and potential energy of all particles

**Heating increases internal energy:**
- Increases particle kinetic energy (temperature rises)
- OR increases particle potential energy (state changes)

**Temperature vs Internal Energy:**
- Temperature: Average kinetic energy of particles
- Internal energy: TOTAL energy (kinetic + potential)

## 3.5 Specific Heat Capacity

**Definition:** Energy needed to raise 1kg of substance by 1°C

**Equation:**
ΔE = mcΔθ
- ΔE = change in energy (J)
- m = mass (kg)
- c = specific heat capacity (J/kg°C)
- Δθ = temperature change (°C)

**Example:** Heat 2kg of water from 20°C to 100°C (c = 4200 J/kg°C)
- ΔE = 2 × 4200 × 80 = **672,000 J = 672 kJ**

**High specific heat capacity (water):**
- Takes lot of energy to heat up
- Good coolant
- Coastal areas have stable temperatures

## 3.6 Latent Heat

**Definition:** Energy needed to change state (without temperature change)

**Specific Latent Heat:**
Energy needed to change state of 1kg of substance

**Equation:**
E = mL
- E = energy (J)
- m = mass (kg)
- L = specific latent heat (J/kg)

**Two types:**
- **Latent heat of fusion:** For melting/freezing
- **Latent heat of vaporization:** For boiling/condensing

**During state change:**
- Temperature stays constant
- Energy used to break/form bonds
- Internal energy changes (potential energy)

## 3.7 Particle Model and Pressure

**Gas pressure caused by:**
- Particles colliding with container walls
- Each collision exerts force

**Increasing pressure:**
- Increase temperature → particles move faster → more frequent, harder collisions
- Decrease volume → particles more concentrated → more frequent collisions

## 3.8 Particle Motion in Gases

**Particles in gas:**
- Move in random directions
- Constant random motion
- Collide with each other and walls

**Absolute zero:** 0 Kelvin (−273°C)
- Lowest possible temperature
- Particles have minimum kinetic energy

**Kelvin scale:**
- T(K) = T(°C) + 273
- Example: 27°C = 300 K

## Practice Questions

1. Describe particle arrangement in a solid
2. Name the change of state from liquid to gas
3. Calculate density: mass 150g, volume 30cm³
4. What is specific heat capacity?
5. Calculate energy to heat 5kg of water by 10°C (c = 4200 J/kg°C)
6. Why does temperature not change during melting?
7. What is absolute zero in Celsius?
8. Convert 127°C to Kelvin
9. Explain why gases exert pressure
10. How does increasing temperature affect gas pressure?

## Key Points
✓ Three states: solid, liquid, gas (differ in particle arrangement and energy)
✓ Density = mass / volume
✓ Specific heat capacity: ΔE = mcΔθ
✓ Latent heat: energy for state change without temperature change
✓ Temperature during state change stays constant
✓ Gas pressure from particle collisions with walls
✓ Absolute zero = 0 K = −273°C
