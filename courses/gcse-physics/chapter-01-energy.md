# Chapter 1: Energy

## Learning Objectives
- Describe energy stores and transfers
- Calculate energy changes and efficiency
- Understand power and energy resources
- Apply conservation of energy principle

## 1.1 Energy Stores

**8 Energy Stores:**
1. **Kinetic** - moving objects
2. **Gravitational potential** - objects in gravitational field
3. **Elastic potential** - stretched/compressed objects
4. **Thermal** - hot objects
5. **Chemical** - food, fuel, batteries
6. **Magnetic** - magnets and magnetic materials
7. **Electrostatic** - charged objects
8. **Nuclear** - atomic nuclei

## 1.2 Energy Transfers

**4 Energy Transfer Pathways:**
1. **Mechanically** - by forces doing work
2. **Electrically** - by electric current
3. **By heating** - due to temperature difference
4. **By radiation** - light, sound, etc.

**Example:** Turning on a light bulb
- Chemical (battery) → Electrical → Light + Thermal

## 1.3 Conservation of Energy

**Principle:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred

**Energy equations:**

**Kinetic Energy:**
KE = ½mv²
- m = mass (kg)
- v = velocity (m/s)

**Gravitational Potential Energy:**
GPE = mgh
- m = mass (kg)
- g = gravitational field strength (9.8 N/kg on Earth)
- h = height (m)

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
EPE = ½ke²
- k = spring constant (N/m)
- e = extension (m)

**Example:** Ball dropped from 10m (mass 0.5kg)
- GPE = 0.5 × 9.8 × 10 = **49 J**
- At bottom: KE = 49 J (ignoring air resistance)

## 1.4 Efficiency

**Efficiency = (Useful energy output / Total energy input) × 100%**

Or: **Efficiency = (Useful power output / Total power input) × 100%**

**Example:** Light bulb uses 100 J, produces 10 J of light
- Efficiency = (10/100) × 100% = **10%**
- Wasted energy = 90 J (as heat)

**Ways to reduce wasted energy:**
- Lubrication (reduces friction)
- Thermal insulation
- Streamlining (reduces air resistance)

## 1.5 Power

**Definition:** Rate of energy transfer

**Power = Energy transferred / Time**
P = E/t

**Units:** Watts (W) = Joules per second (J/s)

**Example:** 2000 J transferred in 5 seconds
- Power = 2000 ÷ 5 = **400 W**

**Also:** Power = Work done / Time

## 1.6 Energy Resources

**Renewable:**
- Solar
- Wind
- Hydroelectric
- Tidal
- Wave
- Geothermal
- Biomass

**Non-renewable:**
- Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
- Nuclear fuel

**Comparison:**

| Resource | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Fossil fuels** | Reliable, high energy density | Pollution, CO₂, finite |
| **Solar** | Free, renewable | Unreliable, expensive setup |
| **Wind** | Renewable, no pollution | Unreliable, visual impact |
| **Nuclear** | High energy, no CO₂ | Radioactive waste, expensive |

## Practice Questions

1. State the principle of conservation of energy
2. Calculate KE of 2kg object moving at 5 m/s
3. A 10kg mass is lifted 3m. Calculate GPE gained
4. A motor transfers 5000 J in 10 seconds. Calculate power
5. Device has efficiency of 40% and 200 J input. Find useful output
6. Name 3 renewable energy sources
7. Calculate efficiency: 30 J useful from 150 J input
8. Why are fossil fuels non-renewable?
9. A spring with k=200 N/m is stretched 0.1m. Calculate EPE
10. Explain one way to improve efficiency of a car

## Key Points
✓ Energy cannot be created or destroyed
✓ KE = ½mv², GPE = mgh
✓ Efficiency = (useful output / total input) × 100%
✓ Power = Energy / Time (measured in Watts)
✓ Renewable resources won't run out
✓ All energy transfers eventually dissipate as heat
