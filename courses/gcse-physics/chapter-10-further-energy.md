# Chapter 10: Further Energy and Electricity (Higher Tier)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand energy efficiency in homes
- Explain the National Grid system
- Describe static electricity
- Analyze complex circuits

## 10.1 Energy Efficiency in the Home

**Energy transfers in homes:**
- Heating: chemical/electrical → thermal
- Lighting: electrical → light (+ thermal waste)
- Appliances: electrical → kinetic/thermal/light/sound

**Reducing energy waste:**

**Insulation:**
- Loft insulation (reduces conduction through roof)
- Cavity wall insulation (reduces convection)
- Double glazing (reduces conduction through windows)
- Draught excluders (reduces convection)

**Cost effectiveness:**
Payback time = Initial cost / Annual saving

**Example:** Loft insulation costs £400, saves £100/year
- Payback time = 400/100 = **4 years**

## 10.2 Energy Resources

**Renewable resources:**
- **Solar:** PV cells, solar panels
- **Wind:** Wind turbines
- **Hydro:** Dams, pumped storage
- **Tidal:** Tidal barrages
- **Wave:** Wave generators
- **Geothermal:** Underground heat
- **Biomass:** Burning organic matter

**Non-renewable:**
- **Fossil fuels:** Coal, oil, gas
- **Nuclear:** Uranium/plutonium

**Environmental impact:**
- Fossil fuels: CO₂ emissions, climate change, pollution
- Nuclear: Radioactive waste
- Renewables: Visual impact, habitat destruction, unreliable

## 10.3 Power Stations

**Process:**
1. Fuel burned (or nuclear fission) heats water
2. Water boils → steam
3. Steam turns turbine
4. Turbine turns generator
5. Generator produces electricity

**Efficiency:**
- Thermal power stations: ~35-45%
- Much energy lost as waste heat
- Combined heat and power (CHP) more efficient

## 10.4 The National Grid

**Components:**
- Power stations
- Step-up transformers (to 400,000V)
- Transmission lines (pylons)
- Step-down transformers (to 230V)
- Homes and businesses

**Why high voltage?**
- High V → low I (for same power)
- Power loss = I²R
- Lower current → less energy wasted as heat
- More efficient transmission

**Example:** 10MW transmitted at 250,000V vs 25,000V
- At 250,000V: I = 40A
- At 25,000V: I = 400A
- Power loss ∝ I², so 100× more loss at lower voltage!

## 10.5 Static Electricity

**Caused by friction:**
- Electrons transferred between objects
- One becomes positive, one negative
- Like charges repel, opposite attract

**Examples:**
- Rubbing balloon on hair
- Lightning (charge builds in clouds)
- Spark when touching metal after walking on carpet

**Uses:**
- **Photocopiers:** Attract toner to paper
- **Spray painting:** Charged paint attracted to object (even coating)
- **Dust precipitators:** Remove smoke particles

**Dangers:**
- Aircraft refueling: static spark could ignite fuel
- Grain silos: grain dust explosion
- Electronic components: can be damaged

## 10.6 Electric Fields

**Around charged objects**

**Field lines:**
- Show direction of force on positive charge
- Point away from positive, towards negative
- Closer lines = stronger field

**Force on charged particle:**
- Opposite charges attract
- Like charges repel
- Force stronger when closer

## 10.7 Complex Circuit Analysis

**Series circuits:**
- Vtotal = V₁ + V₂ + V₃
- I same everywhere
- Rtotal = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

**Parallel circuits:**
- V same across each branch
- Itotal = I₁ + I₂ + I₃
- 1/Rtotal = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

**Power in circuits:**
- P = IV
- P = I²R
- P = V²/R

**Example:** 6V battery, two 3Ω resistors in parallel
- 1/Rtotal = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3
- Rtotal = 1.5Ω
- I = V/R = 6/1.5 = **4A**
- P = IV = 4 × 6 = **24W**

## 10.8 Energy and Charge

**Energy transferred:**
E = VIt
- E = energy (J)
- V = voltage (V)
- I = current (A)
- t = time (s)

**Also:** E = QV
- Q = charge (C)

**Example:** 2A through 12V for 5 minutes
- E = 12 × 2 × 300 = **7200 J = 7.2 kJ**

## 10.9 Domestic Electricity Costs

**Energy (kWh) = Power (kW) × Time (hours)**

**Cost = Energy (kWh) × Price per kWh**

**Example:** 2kW heater for 3 hours, electricity costs 15p/kWh
- Energy = 2 × 3 = 6 kWh
- Cost = 6 × 15p = **90p**

## 10.10 Electrical Safety

**Fuses and circuit breakers:**
- Break circuit if current too high
- Prevent fires from overheating wires

**Earthing:**
- Metal case connected to earth wire
- If live wire touches case, large current flows
- Fuse blows, breaking circuit
- Prevents electric shock

**Double insulation:**
- Plastic casing (insulator)
- No metal parts exposed
- No earth wire needed

**RCD (Residual Current Device):**
- Detects difference in current between live and neutral
- Switches off very quickly
- Prevents electrocution

## Key Points
✓ Insulation reduces heat loss (payback time = cost/saving)
✓ Renewables won't run out but may be unreliable
✓ High voltage transmission reduces energy waste (P = I²R)
✓ Static electricity from friction (electron transfer)
✓ Series: V splits, I same, R adds
✓ Parallel: V same, I splits, 1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂
✓ E = VIt or E = QV
✓ Cost = Power (kW) × Time (h) × Price per kWh
✓ Safety: fuses, earth wire, RCD
