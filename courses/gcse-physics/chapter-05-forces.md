# Chapter 5: Forces

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish scalar and vector quantities
- Apply Newton's laws of motion
- Calculate resultant forces and moments
- Understand momentum and collisions

## 5.1 Scalar and Vector Quantities

**Scalar:** Magnitude only
- Distance, speed, mass, time, energy, temperature

**Vector:** Magnitude AND direction
- Displacement, velocity, force, acceleration, momentum

## 5.2 Forces

**Contact forces:**
- Friction
- Air resistance
- Tension
- Normal contact force

**Non-contact forces:**
- Gravitational
- Electrostatic
- Magnetic

**Resultant force:** Single force that has same effect as all forces combined

## 5.3 Newton's First Law

**An object remains at rest or continues at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force**

**Example:** Car at constant 30 mph → driving force = friction + air resistance (resultant = 0)

## 5.4 Newton's Second Law

**F = ma**
- F = resultant force (N)
- m = mass (kg)
- a = acceleration (m/s²)

**Example:** 500kg car, 2000N force
- a = F/m = 2000/500 = **4 m/s²**

**Inertia:** Tendency to continue in same state of motion; larger mass = more inertia

## 5.5 Newton's Third Law

**For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction**

**Example:** Book on table
- Book pushes down on table (action)
- Table pushes up on book (reaction)
- Forces are equal, opposite, on different objects

## 5.6 Weight and Mass

**Mass:** Amount of matter (kg)
**Weight:** Force due to gravity (N)

**Weight = Mass × Gravitational field strength**
W = mg
- g = 9.8 N/kg on Earth

**Example:** 5kg object
- W = 5 × 9.8 = **49 N**

## 5.7 Forces and Motion

**Velocity-time graphs:**
- Gradient = acceleration
- Area under = displacement

**Distance-time graphs:**
- Gradient = speed

**Acceleration:**
a = (v − u) / t
- a = acceleration (m/s²)
- v = final velocity (m/s)
- u = initial velocity (m/s)
- t = time (s)

**Equations of motion:**
- v² − u² = 2as
- s = (u + v)t / 2

## 5.8 Stopping Distances

**Stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance**

**Thinking distance:** Distance traveled during reaction time
- Increased by: tiredness, alcohol, drugs, distractions

**Braking distance:** Distance to stop once brakes applied
- Increased by: speed, wet/icy roads, worn brakes/tires

## 5.9 Momentum

**Momentum = mass × velocity**
p = mv
- p = momentum (kg m/s)

**Conservation of momentum:**
In a closed system, total momentum before = total momentum after

**Example:** 2kg object at 5 m/s collides with 3kg stationary object, stick together
- Before: (2 × 5) + (3 × 0) = 10 kg m/s
- After: (2 + 3) × v = 10
- v = 10/5 = **2 m/s**

**Force and momentum:**
F = (mv − mu) / t
(Change in momentum / time)

## 5.10 Moments

**Moment = Force × perpendicular distance**
M = Fd
- M = moment (Nm)
- F = force (N)
- d = perpendicular distance from pivot (m)

**Principle of moments:**
For balanced object: Clockwise moments = Anticlockwise moments

**Example:** Seesaw - 500N child 2m from pivot balances 200N child at what distance?
- 500 × 2 = 200 × d
- d = 1000/200 = **5m**

**Centre of mass:** Point where weight of object acts

## Practice Questions

2. State Newton's First Law
3. Calculate force: 10kg mass, 2 m/s² acceleration
4. Calculate weight of 8kg object (g = 9.8 N/kg)
5. What increases thinking distance?
6. Calculate momentum: 50kg at 20 m/s
7. State the principle of moments
8. Calculate moment: 10N force, 0.5m from pivot
9. Two objects collide and stick. Is momentum conserved?
10. What is the unit of momentum?

## Key Points
✓ Scalars: magnitude only; Vectors: magnitude and direction
✓ Newton's Laws: 1) Balanced forces = constant velocity, 2) F=ma, 3) Action-reaction pairs
✓ Weight = mg (g = 9.8 N/kg)
✓ Stopping distance = thinking + braking distance
✓ Momentum = mass × velocity (conserved in collisions)
✓ Moment = force × distance
✓ Balanced moments: clockwise = anticlockwise
