# Chapter 9: Further Mechanics (Higher Tier)

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate stopping distances and braking force
- Understand circular motion
- Apply Hooke's Law
- Understand pressure in fluids

## 9.1 Motion and Forces

**Distance vs Displacement:**
- Distance: Total path length (scalar)
- Displacement: Straight line from start to finish (vector)

**Speed vs Velocity:**
- Speed: distance/time (scalar)
- Velocity: displacement/time (vector)

**Acceleration:**
a = Δv/t = (v − u)/t

## 9.2 Stopping Distances

**Total stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance**

**Thinking distance factors:**
- Reaction time
- Initial speed
- Tiredness, alcohol, drugs, distractions

**Braking distance factors:**
- Speed (squared relationship)
- Mass of vehicle
- Road conditions (wet, icy)
- Tire and brake condition

**Large deceleration:**
- Large braking force needed
- Can cause brakes to overheat
- Loss of control

## 9.3 Work Done and Energy Transfer

**Work done = Force × Distance (in direction of force)**
W = Fs

**Work done against friction → thermal energy**

**Braking:**
- Work done by brakes = kinetic energy lost
- Fs = ½mv²
- Energy transferred to thermal energy (brakes heat up)

## 9.4 Circular Motion

**Objects in circular motion accelerate** (changing direction = changing velocity)

**Centripetal force:**
- Acts towards center
- Keeps object moving in circle
- Provided by tension, friction, or gravity

**Examples:**
- Planet orbiting Sun: gravity provides centripetal force
- Car turning: friction provides centripetal force
- Satellite orbiting Earth: gravity provides centripetal force

**Factors affecting centripetal force:**
- Mass of object
- Speed
- Radius of circle

## 9.5 Hooke's Law

**Extension is directly proportional to force** (up to limit of proportionality)

**F = ke**
- F = force (N)
- k = spring constant (N/m)
- e = extension (m)

**Example:** Spring with k = 50 N/m, force = 10N
- e = F/k = 10/50 = **0.2m = 20cm**

**Elastic deformation:** Returns to original shape when force removed
**Plastic deformation:** Permanently changed shape

**Limit of proportionality:** Point where Hooke's Law stops applying

**Required Practical:** Investigating Hooke's Law

## 9.6 Pressure

**Definition:** Force per unit area

**P = F/A**
- P = pressure (Pa or N/m²)
- F = force (N)
- A = area (m²)

**Example:** 500N force on 2m² area
- P = 500/2 = **250 Pa**

**Small area → high pressure**
(knife blade, drawing pin, high heels)

**Large area → low pressure**
(snowshoes, caterpillar tracks, wide tires)

## 9.7 Pressure in Fluids

**Pressure in liquids:**
- Increases with depth
- Acts in all directions
- Due to weight of liquid above

**Pressure in gases:**
- Particles colliding with container walls
- More collisions → higher pressure

**Atmospheric pressure:**
- ~100,000 Pa at sea level
- Decreases with altitude
- Less air above at high altitude

## 9.8 Upthrust and Flotation

**Upthrust:** Upward force on object in fluid
- Caused by pressure difference (higher at bottom)

**Object floats if:** Upthrust = Weight
**Object sinks if:** Weight > Upthrust

**Density and flotation:**
- Object less dense than fluid: floats
- Object more dense than fluid: sinks

## 9.9 Force-Extension Graphs

**Linear region:**
- Obeys Hooke's Law
- Gradient = spring constant

**Beyond limit of proportionality:**
- Non-linear
- Permanent deformation may occur

**Energy stored = Area under graph**

**Elastic potential energy:**
E = ½ke²

## 9.10 Vehicle Safety

**Safety features:**

**Increasing stopping time (reduces force):**
- Crumple zones
- Airbags
- Seat belts
- Crash barriers

**F = Δ(mv)/t**
- Longer time → smaller force
- Reduces injuries

**Momentum considerations:**
- Momentum must be absorbed/transferred
- Safety features increase time
- F × t = Δ(mv) (constant)
- Longer time = smaller force

4. Calculate extension: F = 20N, k = 100 N/m
5. Define pressure
6. Calculate pressure: 100N force on 0.5m² area
7. Why does pressure increase with depth in liquid?
8. What is upthrust?
9. How do crumple zones improve safety?
10. What is the unit of pressure?

## Key Points
✓ Stopping distance = thinking + braking distance
✓ Work done = force × distance
✓ Circular motion requires centripetal force towards center
✓ Hooke's Law: F = ke (up to limit of proportionality)
✓ Pressure = force / area
✓ Pressure in fluid increases with depth
✓ Upthrust makes objects float if upthrust ≥ weight
✓ Safety features increase collision time to reduce force
