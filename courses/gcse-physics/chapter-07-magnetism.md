# Chapter 7: Magnetism and Electromagnetism

## Learning Objectives
- Describe magnetic fields
- Understand electromagnets
- Explain the motor effect
- Understand electromagnetic induction and transformers

## 7.1 Permanent Magnets

**Magnetic poles:** North and South
**Rule:** Like poles repel, opposite poles attract

**Magnetic field:**
- Region where magnetic force acts
- Direction: North → South
- Shown by field lines

**Magnetic materials:** Iron, steel, cobalt, nickel

## 7.2 Electromagnets

**Current in wire creates magnetic field**

**Solenoid:** Coil of wire
- Acts like bar magnet when current flows
- Stronger with more coils, more current, iron core

**Advantages over permanent magnets:**
- Can be switched on/off
- Strength can be varied
- Direction can be reversed

## 7.3 The Motor Effect

**Current-carrying wire in magnetic field experiences force**

**Fleming's Left-Hand Rule:**
- **First finger:** Field (N → S)
- **SeCond finger:** Current
- **ThuMb:** Motion/Force

**Factors affecting force:**
- Magnetic field strength
- Current
- Length of wire in field

**Force equation:**
F = BIL
- F = force (N)
- B = magnetic flux density (T)
- I = current (A)
- L = length of wire in field (m)

## 7.4 Electric Motors

**Structure:**
- Coil in magnetic field
- Split-ring commutator
- Brushes
- Power supply

**Operation:**
1. Current through coil creates forces
2. Forces cause rotation
3. Commutator reverses current every half turn
4. Continuous rotation

**Increasing speed:**
- More current
- More turns on coil
- Stronger magnet

## 7.5 Electromagnetic Induction

**Inducing voltage:**
- Move wire through magnetic field
- Move magnet near coil
- Change current in nearby coil

**Increasing induced voltage:**
- Move faster
- Stronger magnet
- More turns on coil

**Generator:** Converts kinetic energy → electrical energy

## 7.6 Transformers

**Changes voltage of AC**

**Structure:**
- Primary coil
- Secondary coil
- Iron core (links coils)

**Turns ratio:**
Vₚ/Vₛ = Nₚ/Nₛ

- Vₚ = primary voltage
- Vₛ = secondary voltage
- Nₚ = primary turns
- Nₛ = secondary turns

**Step-up transformer:** Nₛ > Nₚ (increases voltage)
**Step-down transformer:** Nₛ < Nₚ (decreases voltage)

**Example:** Primary 100 turns, 230V. Secondary 25 turns. Find Vₛ.
- 230/Vₛ = 100/25
- Vₛ = (230 × 25)/100 = **57.5V**

**For 100% efficient transformer:**
VₚIₚ = VₛIₛ

## 7.7 National Grid

**Purpose:** Distribute electricity from power stations to consumers

**Why high voltage transmission?**
- High voltage → low current
- Low current → less energy wasted as heat (I²R losses)
- More efficient

**Process:**
1. Power station generates 25,000V
2. Step-up transformer → 400,000V
3. Transmission lines
4. Step-down transformer → 230V for homes
