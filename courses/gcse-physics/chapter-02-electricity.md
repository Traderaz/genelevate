# Chapter 2: Electricity

## Learning Objectives
- Understand current, voltage, and resistance
- Analyze series and parallel circuits
- Apply Ohm's Law
- Understand mains electricity and safety

## 2.1 Current, Voltage, and Resistance

**Current (I):**
- Flow of electric charge
- Measured in Amperes (A)
- Measured with ammeter (in series)

**Voltage/Potential Difference (V):**
- Energy transferred per unit charge
- Measured in Volts (V)
- Measured with voltmeter (in parallel)

**Resistance (R):**
- Opposition to current flow
- Measured in Ohms (Ω)

## 2.2 Ohm's Law

**V = IR**
- V = potential difference (V)
- I = current (A)
- R = resistance (Ω)

**Example:** 12V battery, 3A current flows. Find resistance.
- R = V/I = 12/3 = **4Ω**

## 2.3 Series Circuits

**Rules:**
- Current same everywhere: I₁ = I₂ = I₃
- Voltage splits: Vₜₒₜₐₗ = V₁ + V₂ + V₃
- Resistance adds: Rₜₒₜₐₗ = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

## 2.4 Parallel Circuits

**Rules:**
- Voltage same across each branch: V₁ = V₂ = V₃
- Current splits: Iₜₒₜₐₗ = I₁ + I₂ + I₃
- Total resistance: 1/Rₜₒₜₐₗ = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

## 2.5 Components

**Resistors:**
- Fixed: Constant resistance
- Variable: Adjustable resistance

**Diode:** Allows current in one direction only

**LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):**
- Resistance decreases as light intensity increases

**Thermistor:**
- Resistance decreases as temperature increases

**LED:** Light Emitting Diode - emits light when current flows

## 2.6 I-V Characteristics

**Ohmic conductor:** Straight line through origin (constant R)
**Filament lamp:** Curved (R increases with temperature)
**Diode:** Current only flows one way

## 2.7 Power and Energy

**Power = Current × Voltage**
P = IV

**Also:** P = I²R and P = V²/R

**Energy transferred = Power × Time**
E = Pt

**Example:** 5A through 230V for 2 hours
- P = 5 × 230 = 1150 W
- E = 1150 × 7200 = 8,280,000 J = **8.28 MJ**

## 2.8 Mains Electricity

**UK Mains:** 230V, 50Hz AC

**Plug wiring:**
- **Live (brown):** Alternates between + and −
- **Neutral (blue):** 0V
- **Earth (green/yellow):** Safety, 0V

**Safety features:**
- Fuse: Melts if current too high
- Circuit breaker: Switches off if current too high
- Earth wire: Prevents electric shock
- Double insulation: Plastic casing

## 2.9 Charge and Energy

**Charge = Current × Time**
Q = It
- Q in coulombs (C)

**Energy transferred = Charge × Voltage**
E = QV

## Practice Questions

1. Calculate current if 12V across 4Ω resistor
2. In series: 6V battery, two 3Ω resistors. Find total R and current
3. What happens to total resistance when resistors added in parallel?
4. A 2kW kettle runs for 3 minutes. Calculate energy transferred
5. State the color of the live wire
6. Why is the earth wire important?
7. Calculate charge when 2A flows for 10 seconds
8. Device uses 3A at 230V. Calculate power
9. Explain why filament lamp resistance increases
10. What does a fuse do?

## Key Points
✓ V = IR (Ohm's Law)
✓ Series: current same, voltage splits
✓ Parallel: voltage same, current splits
✓ P = IV, E = Pt, Q = It
✓ UK mains: 230V, Live=brown, Neutral=blue, Earth=green/yellow
✓ Fuses and earth wire provide safety
