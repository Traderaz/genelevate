# Chapter 6: Waves

## Learning Objectives
- Describe transverse and longitudinal waves
- Calculate wave speed, frequency, and wavelength
- Understand the electromagnetic spectrum
- Explain reflection, refraction, and diffraction

## 6.1 Wave Properties

**Wave:** Transfer of energy without transferring matter

**Key terms:**
- **Amplitude:** Maximum displacement from rest
- **Wavelength (λ):** Distance between two peaks
- **Frequency (f):** Number of waves per second (Hz)
- **Period (T):** Time for one complete wave (s)

**Wave equation:**
**v = fλ**
- v = wave speed (m/s)
- f = frequency (Hz)
- λ = wavelength (m)

**Example:** Wave with λ = 2m, f = 5Hz
- v = 5 × 2 = **10 m/s**

## 6.2 Transverse Waves

**Vibrations perpendicular to energy transfer**

Examples:
- Electromagnetic waves (light, radio)
- Water waves
- Waves on strings

## 6.3 Longitudinal Waves

**Vibrations parallel to energy transfer**

Examples:
- Sound waves
- Seismic P-waves

**Features:** Compressions and rarefactions

## 6.4 Electromagnetic Spectrum

**All travel at speed of light in vacuum: 3 × 10⁸ m/s**

Order (increasing frequency, decreasing wavelength):
**Radio → Microwave → Infrared → Visible → UV → X-rays → Gamma**

| Wave | Uses | Dangers |
|------|------|---------|
| **Radio** | Communication, TV/radio | None |
| **Microwave** | Cooking, satellite communication | Internal heating |
| **Infrared** | Remote controls, thermal imaging | Skin burns |
| **Visible** | Sight, photography | None (normal levels) |
| **UV** | Tanning, fluorescence | Skin cancer, eye damage |
| **X-ray** | Medical imaging | Cancer/cell damage |
| **Gamma** | Sterilization, cancer treatment | Cancer/cell damage |

## 6.5 Wave Behaviors

**Reflection:**
- Angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- Smooth surface: clear reflection
- Rough surface: diffuse reflection

**Refraction:**
- Wave changes direction when entering different medium
- Caused by change in speed
- Towards normal: entering denser medium
- Away from normal: entering less dense medium

**Diffraction:**
- Waves spread out through gaps or around obstacles
- More diffraction: smaller gap OR longer wavelength

## 6.6 Sound Waves

**Produced by vibrations**
**Longitudinal waves**

**Speed:** ~330 m/s in air

**Frequency and pitch:**
- High frequency = high pitch
- Low frequency = low pitch

**Amplitude and loudness:**
- Large amplitude = loud sound
- Small amplitude = quiet sound

**Human hearing range:** 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz

**Ultrasound:** Above 20,000 Hz
- Uses: Medical scanning, cleaning, distance measuring
- Sonar: echo location

## 6.7 Seismic Waves

**P-waves (Primary):**
- Longitudinal
- Travel through solids and liquids
- Faster

**S-waves (Secondary):**
- Transverse
- Only through solids
- Slower

**Used to study Earth's structure**

## Practice Questions

1. Define wavelength
2. Calculate wave speed: f = 50Hz, λ = 4m
3. Are sound waves transverse or longitudinal?
4. List the EM spectrum in order of increasing frequency
5. What are microwaves used for?
6. State the law of reflection
7. What is refraction?
8. When does diffraction occur?
9. How does amplitude affect loudness?
10. Why can't S-waves travel through liquid?

## Key Points
✓ Wave equation: v = fλ

✓ All EM waves travel at 3 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum
✓ Reflection: angle in = angle out
✓ Refraction: direction change when speed changes
✓ Diffraction: spreading through gaps
