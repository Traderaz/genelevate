# Chapter 4: Atomic Structure

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the structure of the atom
- Understand isotopes and ions
- Explain radioactive decay and half-life
- Evaluate uses and dangers of radiation

## 4.1 Atomic Structure

**Atom parts:**
- **Nucleus:** Protons + neutrons (most of mass)
- **Electrons:** Orbit nucleus in shells

| Particle | Charge | Mass |
|----------|--------|------|
| Proton | +1 | 1 |
| Neutron | 0 | 1 |
| Electron | −1 | Very small (1/1840) |

**Atomic number (Z):** Number of protons
**Mass number (A):** Protons + neutrons

## 4.2 Isotopes and Ions

**Isotopes:**
- Same element (same protons)
- Different neutrons
- Example: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14

**Ions:**
- Atoms that gain/lose electrons
- Positive ion: lost electrons
- Negative ion: gained electrons

## 4.3 Development of Atomic Model

**Dalton:** Solid spheres
**Thomson:** Plum pudding model
**Rutherford:** Nuclear model (alpha scattering)
**Bohr:** Electrons in shells/orbits
**Modern:** Quantum model

## 4.4 Radioactive Decay

**Unstable nuclei emit radiation to become stable**

**Three types:**

| Type | Nature | Ionizing | Penetration | Stopped by |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Alpha (α)** | 2 protons + 2 neutrons (He nucleus) | High | Low (few cm air) | Paper/skin |
| **Beta (β)** | Electron | Medium | Medium (few m air) | Thin aluminum |
| **Gamma (γ)** | EM wave | Low | High (km air) | Thick lead/concrete |

## 4.5 Decay Equations

**Alpha decay:**
- Mass decreases by 4
- Atomic number decreases by 2
- Example: ²²⁶Ra₈₈ → ²²²Rn₈₆ + ⁴He₂

**Beta decay:**
- Neutron → proton + electron
- Mass stays same
- Atomic number increases by 1
- Example: ¹⁴C₆ → ¹⁴N₇ + ⁰e₋₁

**Gamma emission:**
- No change in mass or atomic number
- Energy released

## 4.6 Half-Life

**Definition:** Time for half the radioactive nuclei to decay

**Example:** 1000 nuclei, half-life = 2 hours
- After 2h: 500 nuclei
- After 4h: 250 nuclei
- After 6h: 125 nuclei

**Calculating remaining amount:**
After n half-lives: Amount = Initial × (½)ⁿ

## 4.7 Uses of Radiation

**Medical:**
- **Tracers:** Gamma (leaves body, detected outside)
- **Radiotherapy:** Gamma (kills cancer cells)
- **Sterilization:** Gamma (kills bacteria)

**Industry:**
- **Thickness control:** Beta (measures paper/metal thickness)
- **Smoke detectors:** Alpha (ionizes air)

**Carbon dating:**
- Uses Carbon-14 (half-life 5730 years)
- Determines age of organic material

## 4.8 Dangers and Safety

**Risks:**
- Ionizes atoms in cells
- Damages DNA
- Can cause cancer
- Mutation in reproductive cells

**Safety:**
- Keep distance (intensity decreases with distance²)
- Minimize exposure time
- Use shielding (lead for gamma)
- Store in lead containers
- Wear protective clothing
- Use tongs/robots

**Background radiation:**
- Always present
- From rocks, cosmic rays, medical, food

## 4.9 Nuclear Fission

**Definition:** Splitting large nucleus into smaller ones, releasing energy

**Process:**
1. Neutron absorbed by uranium-235/plutonium-239
2. Nucleus becomes unstable
3. Splits into two smaller nuclei
4. Releases energy and more neutrons
5. Chain reaction

**Nuclear power stations:**
- Controlled chain reaction
- Heats water → steam → turbine → electricity
- No CO₂ emissions
- Produces radioactive waste

## 4.10 Nuclear Fusion

**Definition:** Joining small nuclei to form larger nucleus

**In stars:**
- Hydrogen → Helium
- Releases enormous energy
- Requires very high temperature and pressure

**Advantages:**
- Abundant fuel (hydrogen from water)
- No radioactive waste
- Safe

**Challenges:**
- Extremely high temperatures needed
- Difficult to contain
- Not yet commercially viable

3. What is an alpha particle?
4. Which radiation is most penetrating?
5. A sample has 800 atoms, half-life 5 years. How many after 10 years?
6. Why is gamma used for medical tracers?
7. What is half-life?
8. Write decay equation for alpha decay of ²³⁸U₉₂
9. Name two safety precautions when handling radioactive sources
10. State one difference between fission and fusion

## Key Points
✓ Atom: nucleus (protons + neutrons) + electrons
✓ Isotopes: same protons, different neutrons
✓ Alpha: He nucleus, stopped by paper
✓ Beta: electron, stopped by aluminum
✓ Gamma: EM wave, needs lead/concrete
✓ Half-life: time for half to decay
✓ Fission: splitting nucleus; Fusion: joining nuclei
✓ Radiation ionizes and can damage cells
