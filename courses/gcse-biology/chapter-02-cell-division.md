# Chapter 2: Cell Division and Stem Cells

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the cell cycle and mitosis
- Explain meiosis and sexual reproduction
- Describe stem cells and their uses
- Evaluate stem cell therapy applications

## 2.1 The Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division.

**Stages:**
1. **Interphase** (Growth and DNA replication)
   - Cell grows and increases subcellular structures
   - DNA replicates to form two copies of each chromosome
   - Longest phase
2. **Mitosis** (Nuclear division)
3. **Cytokinesis** (Cell division)

## 2.2 Mitosis

**Purpose:** Produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair

**Stages of Mitosis:**
1. **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane breaks down
2. **Metaphase:** Chromosomes line up at the cell equator
3. **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles
4. **Telophase:** Nuclear membranes form around each set of chromosomes
5. **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasm divides, forming two cells

**Key points:**
- Produces diploid cells (full set of chromosomes)
- Daughter cells are genetically identical to parent
- Used for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction

## 2.3 Meiosis

**Purpose:** Produces gametes (sex cells) for sexual reproduction

**Key features:**
- Two divisions (Meiosis I and II)
- Produces four non-identical haploid cells
- Gametes have half the number of chromosomes
- Introduces genetic variation

**Meiosis vs Mitosis:**
| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Number of divisions | 1 | 2 |
| Daughter cells | 2 | 4 |
| Chromosome number | Diploid | Haploid |
| Genetic variation | No | Yes |
| Purpose | Growth/repair | Gamete production |

## 2.4 Stem Cells

**Definition:** Undifferentiated cells that can divide and develop into different cell types

**Types:**

**1. Embryonic Stem Cells**
- From embryos
- Can differentiate into ANY cell type (pluripotent)
- Ethical concerns about using embryos

**2. Adult Stem Cells**
- Found in specific tissues (e.g., bone marrow)
- Can only differentiate into LIMITED cell types
- Less ethical concerns

**3. Plant Meristems**
- Found in growing tips of shoots and roots
- Can differentiate into any plant cell throughout life

**Uses of stem cells:**
- Treating diseases (diabetes, paralysis)
- Growing replacement organs
- Drug testing
- Research into embryo development

**Arguments FOR stem cell research:**
- Could cure serious diseases
- Reduce need for organ donors
- Potential to save lives

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Involves destruction of embryos
- Risk of virus transmission
- Religious/ethical objections
- Long-term effects unknown

## Practice Questions

1. Name the three stages of the cell cycle
2. How many cells are produced by mitosis?
3. What is the purpose of meiosis?
4. Define a stem cell
5. State one difference between embryonic and adult stem cells
6. Explain why meiosis produces genetic variation
7. A human body cell has 46 chromosomes. How many will a gamete have?
8. Describe one use of stem cells in medicine
9. Give one ethical argument against embryonic stem cell research
10. Explain why plant cloning is easier than animal cloning

## Key Points
✓ Mitosis produces 2 identical diploid cells
✓ Meiosis produces 4 non-identical haploid cells
✓ Stem cells can differentiate into different cell types
✓ Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent
✓ Stem cell research has ethical considerations
