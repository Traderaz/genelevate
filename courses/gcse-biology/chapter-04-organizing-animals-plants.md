# Chapter 4: Organizing Animals and Plants

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the structure and function of the heart and blood vessels
- Explain the components and functions of blood
- Understand plant transport systems
- Describe transpiration and translocation

## 4.1 The Heart and Circulation

**Double Circulation System:**
1. **Pulmonary circulation:** Heart → Lungs → Heart
2. **Systemic circulation:** Heart → Body → Heart

**Heart Structure:**
- **4 chambers:** 2 atria (top), 2 ventricles (bottom)
- **Right side:** Pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs
- **Left side:** Pumps oxygenated blood to body
- **Valves:** Prevent backflow of blood
- **Left ventricle:** Thicker wall (pumps blood further)

**Pacemaker:**
- Group of cells in right atrium
- Controls heart rate by sending electrical impulses
- Artificial pacemakers can regulate irregular heartbeats

## 4.2 Blood Vessels

| Vessel | Structure | Function |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Artery** | Thick muscular walls, small lumen, elastic fibers | Carries blood AWAY from heart at HIGH pressure |
| **Vein** | Thin walls, large lumen, valves | Carries blood TO heart at LOW pressure |
| **Capillary** | One cell thick walls, tiny lumen | Exchange of materials with tissues |

## 4.3 Blood Components

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Red blood cells** | Carry oxygen (contain hemoglobin) |
| **White blood cells** | Fight infection (phagocytosis, antibody production) |
| **Platelets** | Blood clotting |
| **Plasma** | Liquid carrying dissolved substances (glucose, CO₂, hormones, urea) |

**Adaptations of red blood cells:**
- Biconcave shape (large surface area)
- No nucleus (more space for hemoglobin)
- Contain hemoglobin (binds oxygen)

## 4.4 Coronary Heart Disease

**Cause:** Fatty deposits (plaques) build up in coronary arteries

**Effects:**
- Reduced blood flow to heart muscle
- Heart muscle receives less oxygen
- Can lead to heart attack

**Treatments:**
- **Stents:** Keep arteries open
- **Statins:** Drugs that reduce cholesterol
- **Heart transplant:** Replace damaged heart
- **Artificial hearts:** Temporary solution

## 4.5 Plant Tissues and Organs

**Plant Organs:**
- **Roots:** Absorb water and minerals
- **Stem:** Supports plant, transports substances
- **Leaves:** Photosynthesis

**Plant Tissues:**
- **Epidermal tissue:** Covers surfaces
- **Mesophyll tissue:** Carries out photosynthesis
- **Xylem:** Transports water and minerals UP
- **Phloem:** Transports sugars UP and DOWN

## 4.6 Transpiration

**Definition:** Loss of water vapor from leaves through stomata

**Transpiration Stream:**
Water lost from leaves → creates suction → pulls water up xylem → water absorbed by roots

**Factors Affecting Transpiration Rate:**
- ↑ Temperature → ↑ transpiration
- ↑ Humidity → ↓ transpiration
- ↑ Air movement (wind) → ↑ transpiration
- ↑ Light intensity → ↑ transpiration (stomata open)

**Stomata:**
- Pores on leaf surface (mainly underside)
- Surrounded by guard cells
- Open during day (for gas exchange)
- Close at night (reduce water loss)

## 4.7 Translocation

**Definition:** Movement of sugars (from photosynthesis) from leaves to other parts of plant

**Key points:**
- Occurs in phloem
- Requires energy (active process)
- Moves up AND down the plant
- Sugars transported as sucrose

## Practice Questions

1. Name the four chambers of the heart
2. Why does the left ventricle have a thicker wall than the right?
3. Which blood vessel has valves?
4. What is the function of red blood cells?
5. What causes coronary heart disease?
6. Name the two plant transport tissues
7. Define transpiration
8. Why do stomata close at night?
9. What is translocation?
10. Explain why capillaries have thin walls

## Key Points
✓ Heart has 4 chambers; left ventricle has thickest wall
✓ Arteries carry blood away from heart; veins return blood
✓ Red blood cells transport oxygen using hemoglobin
✓ Xylem transports water UP; phloem transports sugars
✓ Transpiration is loss of water from leaves
✓ Stomata control gas exchange and water loss
