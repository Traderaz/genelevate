# Chapter 6: Preventing and Treating Disease

## Learning Objectives
- Understand drug development and testing
- Explain how monoclonal antibodies work
- Evaluate uses of monoclonal antibodies
- Describe plant disease detection and identification

## 6.1 Drug Development

**Stages of drug testing:**

1. **Preclinical Testing:**
   - Tested on cells, tissues, and live animals
   - Tests for toxicity, efficacy, and dosage
   - Ensures drug works and is safe

2. **Clinical Trials:**
   - Phase 1: Tested on healthy volunteers (small numbers) - safety
   - Phase 2: Tested on patients (larger numbers) - efficacy and dosage
   - Phase 3: Large-scale trials comparing with existing treatments

**Placebo:** Substance with no drug effect (looks identical to real drug)

**Double-blind trial:** Neither patient nor doctor knows who has placebo

**Why use placebos and double-blind?**
- Eliminates bias
- Accounts for placebo effect
- Provides reliable data

## 6.2 Monoclonal Antibodies

**Production:**
1. Mouse immunized with antigen
2. Mouse produces lymphocytes (antibody-producing cells)
3. Lymphocytes fused with tumor cells
4. Forms **hybridoma cells** (immortal + produce antibodies)
5. Hybridomas divide to produce clones
6. Clones produce identical antibodies (**monoclonal**)

**Uses:**

**1. Pregnancy Tests:**
- Detect hormone (hCG) in urine
- Monoclonal antibodies bind to hCG
- Causes color change on test strip

**2. Diagnosis:**
- Detect specific antigens on pathogens or cancer cells
- Can be attached to fluorescent dye for visualization

**3. Treatment:**
- Cancer: Antibodies attached to radioactive substance/drug
- Targets cancer cells specifically
- Reduces damage to healthy cells

**Advantages:**
- Very specific
- Can target diseased cells

**Disadvantages:**
- More side effects than expected
- Expensive to produce
- Not as successful as hoped in treating cancer

## 6.3 Plant Diseases

**Signs of disease:**
- Stunted growth
- Spots on leaves
- Areas of decay
- Abnormal growths
- Malformed stems/leaves
- Discoloration
- Presence of pests

**Identification methods:**
- Visual observation
- **Lab testing:** Identify pathogens
- **Monoclonal antibody kits:** Detect specific antigens
- **DNA analysis:** Identify pathogen species

**Mineral Deficiencies:**

| Mineral | Deficiency Symptoms |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Nitrate** | Stunted growth, yellow older leaves |
| **Phosphate** | Poor root growth, purple leaves |
| **Potassium** | Yellow leaves with dead spots |
| **Magnesium** | Yellow leaves (needed for chlorophyll) |

**Plant Defense Responses:**

**Physical:**
- Waxy cuticle
- Cell walls
- Layers of dead cells (bark)

**Chemical:**
- Antibacterial chemicals
- Poisons to deter herbivores

**Mechanical:**
- Thorns and hairs
- Leaves that curl/droop

## Practice Questions

1. Why are drugs tested on animals before humans?
2. What is a placebo?
3. Why use double-blind trials?
4. What are monoclonal antibodies?
5. How are monoclonal antibodies produced?
6. Give one medical use of monoclonal antibodies
7. Name one disadvantage of monoclonal antibody treatment
8. How can you identify a plant disease?
9. What causes yellow leaves in plants?
10. Name two physical plant defenses

## Key Points
✓ Drugs tested on cells, animals, then humans (clinical trials)
✓ Double-blind trials use placebos to eliminate bias
✓ Monoclonal antibodies are specific, identical antibodies
✓ Used in pregnancy tests, diagnosis, and cancer treatment
✓ Plant diseases detected by observation and lab testing
✓ Mineral deficiencies cause specific symptoms
