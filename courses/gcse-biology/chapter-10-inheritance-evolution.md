## Learning Objectives
- Understand DNA structure and the genome
- Explain genetic inheritance and genetic diagrams
- Describe inherited disorders and sex determination
- Understand variation, natural selection, and evolution
- Explain selective breeding and genetic engineering

## 10.1 DNA and the Genome

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):**
- Contains genetic information
- Double helix structure
- Made of two strands coiled together
- Each strand made of nucleotides

**Nucleotide Structure:**
- Sugar
- Phosphate
- Base (A, T, C, or G)

**Base Pairing:**
- A pairs with T
- C pairs with G
- Held by weak hydrogen bonds

**Genome:**
- Entire genetic material of an organism
- Understanding genome helps:
  - Search for genes linked to diseases
  - Understand and treat inherited disorders
  - Trace human migration patterns

**Gene:** Small section of DNA on a chromosome that codes for a specific protein

**Chromosome:** Long strand of DNA containing many genes

**Humans:** 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total)

## 10.2 Protein Synthesis

**Two stages:**

**1. Transcription (in nucleus):**
- DNA strand acts as template
- mRNA (messenger RNA) copy made
- mRNA leaves nucleus

**2. Translation (at ribosome):**
- mRNA attaches to ribosome
- Ribosome reads code (codons)
- tRNA brings specific amino acids
- Amino acids join to form protein

**Genetic Code:**
- Sequence of three bases (codon) codes for one amino acid
- Different sequences code for different amino acids
- Sequence of amino acids determines protein shape and function

## 10.3 Genetic Inheritance

**Key Terms:**
- **Allele:** Different version of a gene
- **Dominant:** Allele expressed even if only one copy present (capital letter, e.g., B)
- **Recessive:** Only expressed if two copies present (lowercase, e.g., b)
- **Homozygous:** Two identical alleles (BB or bb)
- **Heterozygous:** Two different alleles (Bb)
- **Genotype:** Genetic makeup (e.g., Bb)
- **Phenotype:** Physical characteristic (e.g., brown eyes)

## 10.4 Genetic Diagrams

**Monohybrid Cross:**

**Example:** Eye color - Brown (B) dominant, Blue (b) recessive

Parents: Bb × Bb

```
       B    b
   ┌────┬────┐
B  │ BB │ Bb │
   ├────┼────┤
b  │ Bb │ bb │
   └────┴────┘
```

**Ratio:** 3 brown : 1 blue (3:1)
**Genotype ratio:** 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb

## 10.5 Inherited Disorders

**Polydactyly:**
- Extra fingers or toes
- **Dominant** disorder
- Only need one allele (D) to have condition

**Cystic Fibrosis:**
- Excess mucus in lungs and digestive system
- **Recessive** disorder
- Need two alleles (ff) to have condition
- Carriers (Ff) don't have symptoms

**Example:** Two carriers (Ff × Ff)

```
Ratio: 3 normal : 1 affected (25% chance)
Carrier ratio: 2 carriers : 1 unaffected
```

## 10.6 Sex Determination

**Sex Chromosomes:**
- Females: XX
- Males: XY

**Inheritance:**

```
       X    X
   ┌────┬────┐
X  │ XX │ XX │  Female
   ├────┼────┤
Y  │ XY │ XY │  Male
   └────┴────┘
```

**Ratio:** 50% male, 50% female

## 10.7 Variation

**Types:**

**1. Genetic Variation:**
- Due to different alleles
- Inherited from parents
- Caused by:
  - Mutations
  - Meiosis (creates unique gametes)
  - Sexual reproduction (combination of genes)

**2. Environmental Variation:**
- Influenced by environment
- Examples: Scars, language, muscle development

**Most characteristics:** Combination of genetic and environmental factors (e.g., height, skin color)

## 10.8 Evolution and Natural Selection

**Evolution:** Gradual change in inherited characteristics of a population over time

**Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection:**

1. **Variation** exists within a population (due to mutations)
2. **Competition** for resources (not all survive)
3. **Survival of the fittest:** Organisms with advantageous characteristics more likely to survive
4. **Reproduction:** Survivors breed and pass on advantageous alleles
5. **Over time:** Frequency of advantageous alleles increases

**Evidence for Evolution:**
- Fossils show gradual changes
- Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
- DNA similarities between species

**Antibiotic Resistance Example:**
1. Random mutation makes some bacteria resistant
2. Antibiotics kill non-resistant bacteria
3. Resistant bacteria survive and reproduce
4. Population becomes resistant

## 10.9 Selective Breeding

**Definition:** Breeding organisms with desirable characteristics

**Process:**
1. Select parents with desired characteristics
2. Breed them together
3. Select offspring with best characteristics
4. Repeat over many generations

**Examples:**
- Cows that produce more milk
- Dogs with desired temperament
- Wheat with high yield

**Disadvantages:**
- Reduced genetic variation (inbreeding)
- Increased risk of inherited defects
- Vulnerable to new diseases

## 10.10 Genetic Engineering

**Definition:** Transferring genes from one organism to another

**Process:**
1. Identify desired gene
2. Use enzymes to "cut out" gene
3. Insert gene into vector (usually virus or plasmid)
4. Insert vector into target organism
5. Gene expressed in new organism

**Examples:**
- **Insulin production:** Human insulin gene in bacteria
- **Golden Rice:** Vitamin A gene inserted
- **Herbicide-resistant crops**

**Benefits:**
- Increased food production
- Medical applications
- Disease resistance

**Concerns:**
- Long-term effects unknown
- Ethical concerns
- GM crops may affect wild plants
- Concerns about "playing God"

## 10.11 Cloning

**Tissue Culture (Plants):**
- Take small groups of cells from parent plant
- Grow in sterile conditions with nutrients
- Produces genetically identical plants

**Embryo Transplants (Animals):**
- Split embryo into separate cells
- Each cell develops into genetically identical embryo
- Implant into surrogate mothers

**Adult Cell Cloning:**
1. Remove nucleus from egg cell
2. Insert nucleus from adult body cell
3. Stimulate cell to divide
4. Embryo implanted into surrogate

## Practice Questions

1. What is a gene?
2. How many pairs of chromosomes do humans have?
3. Define dominant and recessive alleles
4. If B = brown eyes (dominant) and b = blue eyes, what phenotype is Bb?
5. What is the sex chromosome combination for females?
6. What causes genetic variation?
7. Define natural selection
8. Give one example of selective breeding
9. Name one use of genetic engineering
10. What is cloning?

## Key Points
✓ DNA is a double helix made of nucleotides
✓ Genes code for proteins
✓ Dominant alleles expressed with one copy; recessive need two
✓ Sex determined by X and Y chromosomes (XX = female, XY = male)
✓ Natural selection causes evolution over time
✓ Selective breeding reduces genetic variation
✓ Genetic engineering transfers genes between organisms
✓ Cloning produces genetically identical organisms
