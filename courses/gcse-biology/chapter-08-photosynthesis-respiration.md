# Chapter 8: Photosynthesis and Respiration

## Learning Objectives
- Understand photosynthesis equation and process
- Explain factors affecting photosynthesis rate
- Describe aerobic and anaerobic respiration
- Understand metabolism

## 8.1 Photosynthesis

**Definition:** Process by which plants make glucose using light energy

**Word Equation:**
carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen
                    (light energy)

**Symbol Equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
           (light, chlorophyll)

**Key Points:**
- **Endothermic** reaction (takes in energy from surroundings)
- Occurs in **chloroplasts**
- **Chlorophyll** absorbs light energy
- Mainly occurs in leaves (but any green part)

## 8.2 Uses of Glucose

Plants use glucose produced in photosynthesis for:

1. **Respiration:** Release energy
2. **Making cellulose:** For cell walls (strengthens)
3. **Making amino acids:** Combined with nitrates from soil, for proteins
4. **Stored as starch:** Insoluble storage molecule
5. **Stored as lipids (fats/oils):** In seeds

## 8.3 Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

**Limiting Factors:** Factors that limit the rate of reaction

**1. Light Intensity:**
- ↑ Light → ↑ photosynthesis rate (up to a point)
- At high light intensity, another factor becomes limiting

**2. Carbon Dioxide Concentration:**
- ↑ CO₂ → ↑ photosynthesis rate (up to a point)

**3. Temperature:**
- ↑ Temperature → ↑ rate (enzymes work faster)
- Too high → enzymes denature → rate decreases

**4. Chlorophyll Amount:**
- Disease or lack of minerals → less chlorophyll
- Reduced photosynthesis

**Inverse Square Law (Higher Tier):**
Light intensity ∝ 1/distance²

As distance from light source doubles, light intensity reduces to 1/4

## 8.4 Required Practical: Investigating Photosynthesis

**Using Pondweed:**

Method:
1. Place pondweed in beaker of water
2. Add sodium hydrogencarbonate (provides CO₂)
3. Shine light at set distance
4. Count bubbles of oxygen in set time
5. Repeat at different distances

**Variables:**
- **Independent:** Distance from light/light intensity
- **Dependent:** Number of bubbles (rate of photosynthesis)
- **Control:** Temperature, CO₂ concentration, time period

## 8.5 Greenhouses and Farming

**Optimizing conditions:**
- **Artificial light:** Photosynthesis in winter/night
- **Heaters:** Maintain optimum temperature
- **CO₂ enrichment:** Increase CO₂ levels
- **Ventilation:** Prevent overheating

**Cost vs Benefit:** Farmers must balance cost of equipment against increased crop yield

## 8.6 Aerobic Respiration

**Definition:** Release of energy from glucose using oxygen

**Word Equation:**
glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (+ energy)

**Symbol Equation:**
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O (+ ATP)

**Key Points:**
- **Exothermic** reaction (releases energy)
- Occurs in **mitochondria**
- Continuous process in living cells
- Energy transferred to ATP

## 8.7 Anaerobic Respiration

**Definition:** Release of energy from glucose WITHOUT oxygen

**In Animals:**
glucose → lactic acid (+ energy)

**In Plants and Yeast:**
glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ energy)

**Comparison with Aerobic:**
- Less energy released
- Glucose not completely broken down
- Useful when oxygen not available

## 8.8 Response to Exercise

**During exercise:**
1. Muscle cells need more energy
2. Breathing rate and volume increase
3. Heart rate increases
4. Blood vessels to muscles dilate

**If insufficient oxygen:**
- Anaerobic respiration in muscles
- Produces lactic acid
- Causes muscle fatigue and pain

**Oxygen Debt:**
- Amount of oxygen needed to break down lactic acid
- Explains why breathing remains rapid after exercise
- Lactic acid transported to liver and broken down

## 8.9 Metabolism

**Definition:** Sum of all chemical reactions in an organism

**Examples of Metabolic Reactions:**
- **Photosynthesis:** Making glucose
- **Respiration:** Breaking down glucose
- **Protein synthesis:** Amino acids → proteins
- **Lipid formation:** Fatty acids + glycerol → lipids
- **Glucose conversion:** Glucose → starch/cellulose/glycogen

## Key Points
✓ Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O → glucose + O₂ (requires light)
✓ Endothermic reaction occurring in chloroplasts
✓ Rate affected by light, CO₂, temperature, chlorophyll
✓ Aerobic respiration: glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy
✓ Anaerobic respiration releases less energy, produces lactic acid (animals) or ethanol + CO₂ (plants/yeast)
✓ Metabolism is all chemical reactions in the body
