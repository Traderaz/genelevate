# Chapter 7: Non-Communicable Diseases

## Learning Objectives
- Understand risk factors for non-communicable diseases
- Explain the effects of lifestyle on health
- Describe cancer and tumor formation
- Evaluate data on disease risk factors

## 7.1 Non-Communicable Diseases

**Definition:** Diseases that cannot be spread between individuals

**Examples:**
- Cancer
- Cardiovascular disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Liver disease
- Lung disease

**Risk Factors:**
- Aspects of lifestyle or environment that increase disease risk
- Can be genetic, lifestyle, or environmental

## 7.2 Cancer

**Tumors:**
- Result of uncontrolled cell division
- Caused by changes (mutations) in genes

**Types:**

| Type | Spread? | Treatment |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Benign** | No - contained in one place | Often removed by surgery |
| **Malignant** (Cancer) | Yes - invade tissues, spread via blood | Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery |

**Risk Factors for Cancer:**
- Smoking (lung cancer)
- UV exposure (skin cancer)
- Viral infections (cervical cancer - HPV)
- Genetics (some cancers run in families)
- Carcinogens (chemicals that cause cancer)

## 7.3 Smoking and Health

**Chemicals in cigarettes:**
- **Nicotine:** Addictive, increases heart rate
- **Tar:** Carcinogen, damages cilia in airways
- **Carbon monoxide:** Reduces oxygen transport

**Effects of smoking:**
- **Lung cancer:** Carcinogens in tar
- **COPD** (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease): Breathlessness, damaged alveoli
- **Cardiovascular disease:** Damages blood vessel linings
- **Pregnancy:** Low birth weight, premature birth

**Smoking during pregnancy:**
- Reduces oxygen to fetus
- Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin
- Toxins pass through placenta

## 7.4 Alcohol

**Effects on Body:**

**Short-term:**
- Slows reactions
- Impairs judgment
- Causes dehydration

**Long-term:**
- **Liver disease** (cirrhosis): Liver cells die and scar tissue forms
- **Brain damage:** Permanent damage to brain tissue
- **Cardiovascular disease**
- **Addiction**

**Alcohol in Pregnancy:**
- Fetal alcohol syndrome
- Learning difficulties
- Facial abnormalities

## 7.5 Diet and Exercise

**Obesity:**
- Caused by imbalance: energy intake > energy expenditure
- Measured using BMI (Body Mass Index)

**Health risks of obesity:**
- Type 2 diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Cardiovascular disease
- Joint problems

**Type 2 Diabetes:**
- Body stops responding to insulin
- Blood glucose not properly controlled
- Risk factors: Obesity, lack of exercise, genetics, age

**Exercise Benefits:**
- Reduces obesity risk
- Improves cardiovascular health
- Strengthens bones
- Improves mental health

## 7.6 Cardiovascular Disease

**Causes:**
- **Atherosclerosis:** Fatty deposits in arteries
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Smoking

**Consequences:**
- **Coronary heart disease:** Reduced blood flow to heart
- **Heart attack:** Heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen
- **Stroke:** Blood clot blocks blood vessel in brain

**Prevention:**
- Healthy diet (low fat, low salt, high fiber)
- Regular exercise
- Avoid smoking
- Moderate alcohol consumption

## 7.7 Interpreting Data

**Correlation vs Causation:**
- **Correlation:** Two factors are linked (often shown on graphs)
- **Causation:** One factor directly causes the other

**Important:** Correlation does NOT always mean causation!

**Example:** Ice cream sales correlate with drownings
- Not causation - ice cream doesn't cause drowning
- Both increase in summer (confounding variable)

## Practice Questions

1. What is a non-communicable disease?
2. Define a risk factor
3. What is the difference between benign and malignant tumors?
4. Name two chemicals found in cigarettes
5. How does smoking cause lung cancer?
6. What is cirrhosis?
7. How does obesity increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes?
8. What is atherosclerosis?
9. Explain the difference between correlation and causation
10. Suggest three ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease

## Key Points
✓ Non-communicable diseases cannot be transmitted between people
✓ Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread
✓ Smoking causes lung cancer, COPD, and cardiovascular disease
✓ Excessive alcohol damages the liver (cirrhosis) and brain
✓ Obesity increases risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease
✓ Correlation does not always mean causation
