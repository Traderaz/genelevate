# Chapter 3: Organization and the Digestive System

## Learning Objectives
- Understand levels of organization
- Describe the human digestive system
- Explain how enzymes work
- Conduct food tests

## 3.1 Levels of Organization

**Hierarchy:**
Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems → Organism

**Definitions:**
- **Tissue:** Group of similar cells working together (e.g., muscle tissue)
- **Organ:** Group of different tissues working together (e.g., stomach)
- **Organ System:** Group of organs working together (e.g., digestive system)

## 3.2 The Digestive System

**Organs and Functions:**

| Organ | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Mouth** | Mechanical digestion (chewing), starts starch digestion (amylase) |
| **Esophagus** | Moves food to stomach by peristalsis |
| **Stomach** | Produces acid (kills bacteria), protease enzyme (pepsin) |
| **Small intestine** | Digestion completed, nutrients absorbed |
| **Large intestine** | Water absorbed |
| **Liver** | Produces bile |
| **Pancreas** | Produces digestive enzymes |
| **Gall bladder** | Stores bile |

**Bile:**
- Made in liver, stored in gall bladder
- Neutralizes stomach acid (alkaline)
- Emulsifies fats (breaks into droplets) → increases surface area

## 3.3 Enzymes

**Definition:** Biological catalysts that speed up reactions without being used up

**Key features:**
- Made of protein
- Have an active site (specific shape)
- Substrate fits into active site (lock and key model)
- **Specific** - each enzyme only works on one substrate
- Affected by temperature and pH

**Enzyme Activity and Temperature:**
- As temperature increases, rate increases
- **Optimum temperature:** ~37°C (human body)
- Above optimum: enzyme **denatures** (active site changes shape)

**Enzyme Activity and pH:**
- Each enzyme has optimum pH
- Wrong pH can denature enzyme

**Digestive Enzymes:**

| Enzyme | Substrate | Products | Where Produced | Where Works |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Amylase** | Starch | Maltose (sugar) | Salivary glands, pancreas | Mouth, small intestine |
| **Protease** | Proteins | Amino acids | Stomach, pancreas | Stomach, small intestine |
| **Lipase** | Lipids (fats) | Fatty acids + glycerol | Pancreas | Small intestine |

## 3.4 Food Tests

**Required Practical:**

| Food | Test | Positive Result |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Starch** | Add iodine solution | Blue-black color |
| **Glucose** | Benedict's test (heat) | Brick red precipitate |
| **Protein** | Biuret test | Purple/lilac color |
| **Lipids** | Sudan III OR ethanol + water | Red layer OR cloudy white emulsion |

## 3.5 Absorption

**Small Intestine Adaptations:**
- Very long (provides time for absorption)
- Folded with villi (increase surface area)
- Villi have microvilli (further increase surface area)
- Thin walls (short diffusion distance)
- Good blood supply (maintains concentration gradient)

## Practice Questions

1. What is a tissue?
2. Name the organ where proteins are first digested
3. What is the function of bile?
4. What is an enzyme?
5. What happens to an enzyme when it denatures?
6. Which enzyme digests starch?
7. What are the products of protein digestion?
8. How would you test for starch?
9. Explain why the small intestine is adapted for absorption
10. Why does enzyme activity decrease above optimum temperature?

## Key Points
✓ Organization: Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems
✓ Digestive enzymes break down large molecules
✓ Amylase: starch → sugars; Protease: protein → amino acids; Lipase: fats → fatty acids + glycerol
✓ Enzymes have specific optimum temperature and pH
✓ Villi increase surface area for absorption
