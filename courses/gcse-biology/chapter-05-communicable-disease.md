# Chapter 5: Communicable Disease

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what pathogens are and how they spread
- Describe viral, bacterial, fungal, and protist diseases
- Explain the body's defense systems
- Understand how vaccination works

## 5.1 Pathogens

**Definition:** Microorganisms that cause infectious disease

**Types:**
1. **Bacteria** - produce toxins that damage tissues
2. **Viruses** - live and reproduce inside cells, damaging them
3. **Fungi** - single-celled or have hyphae
4. **Protists** - single-celled eukaryotes

## 5.2 How Diseases Spread

**Methods:**
- **Air:** Droplets from coughs/sneezes (influenza, tuberculosis)
- **Direct contact:** Touching infected person/surfaces (athlete's foot)
- **Water:** Contaminated drinking water (cholera)
- **Vectors:** Animals that carry pathogens (mosquitoes → malaria)

## 5.3 Viral Diseases

**Measles:**
- Spread by droplet infection
- Symptoms: Fever, red rash
- Can be fatal
- **Prevention:** Vaccination

**HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus):**
- Spread by sexual contact or exchange of body fluids
- Attacks immune system cells
- Can lead to AIDS (when immune system fails)
- **Treatment:** Antiretroviral drugs (control virus, not cure)

**Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV):**
- Affects plants
- Causes mosaic pattern on leaves
- Reduces photosynthesis → reduced growth

## 5.4 Bacterial Diseases

**Salmonella:**
- Food poisoning
- Spread through undercooked food
- Symptoms: Fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea
- **Prevention:** Vaccinate poultry, cook food thoroughly

**Gonorrhea:**
- STI (sexually transmitted infection)
- Symptoms: Discharge, pain when urinating
- **Treatment:** Antibiotics (some strains now resistant)
- **Prevention:** Barrier contraception

## 5.5 Fungal and Protist Diseases

**Rose Black Spot (Fungal):**
- Purple/black spots on rose leaves
- Leaves turn yellow and drop
- Reduces photosynthesis
- **Treatment:** Remove affected leaves, fungicide sprays

**Malaria (Protist):**
- Caused by Plasmodium (protist)
- Spread by mosquitoes (vector)
- Symptoms: Fever, can be fatal
- **Prevention:** Mosquito nets, insecticides, antimalarial drugs

## 5.6 Human Defence Systems

**Non-Specific Defences:**

1. **Skin:** Physical barrier, produces antimicrobial secretions
2. **Nose:** Hairs and mucus trap particles
3. **Trachea and Bronchi:** Mucus traps pathogens, cilia waft mucus up to be swallowed
4. **Stomach:** Produces hydrochloric acid (kills pathogens)

**Specific Immune Response:**

1. **Phagocytosis:** White blood cells engulf and digest pathogens
2. **Antibody Production:**
   - Lymphocytes detect antigens on pathogens
   - Produce specific antibodies
   - Antibodies attach to antigens
   - Pathogen destroyed
3. **Antitoxin Production:** Neutralize toxins

**Memory Cells:**
- Remain after infection
- Produce antibodies rapidly if same pathogen returns
- Provides immunity

## 5.7 Vaccination

**How it works:**
1. Inject dead/inactive pathogens
2. Body produces antibodies and memory cells
3. If real pathogen enters, rapid immune response
4. Person is **immune**

**Benefits:**
- Prevented millions of deaths
- Eradicated smallpox
- Nearly eradicated polio

**Herd immunity:** If large % of population vaccinated, disease spread is reduced

## 5.8 Antibiotics and Painkillers

**Antibiotics:**
- Kill bacterial pathogens
- **Cannot** kill viruses
- Specific bacteria need specific antibiotics

**Antibiotic Resistance:**
- Some bacteria mutate → resistant to antibiotics
- Overuse/misuse of antibiotics increases resistance
- MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics

**Reducing antibiotic resistance:**
- Complete full course
- Don't use for viral infections
- Develop new antibiotics

**Painkillers:**
- Relieve symptoms
- Don't kill pathogens

## Practice Questions

1. What is a pathogen?
2. Name two ways diseases can spread
3. Which type of pathogen causes measles?
4. How is malaria transmitted?
5. Name one non-specific defence mechanism
6. What do antibodies do?
7. Explain how vaccination provides immunity
8. Why don't antibiotics work on viruses?
9. What is antibiotic resistance?
10. Suggest two ways to reduce the spread of disease

## Key Points
✓ Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists
✓ Diseases spread by air, water, direct contact, or vectors
✓ Body has non-specific (skin, stomach acid) and specific (antibodies) defenses
✓ Vaccination provides immunity using dead/inactive pathogens
✓ Antibiotics kill bacteria but not viruses
✓ Antibiotic resistance is increasing due to overuse
