# Chapter 9: Homeostasis and Response

## Learning Objectives
- Understand homeostasis principles
- Describe the nervous system structure and function
- Explain the endocrine system and hormones
- Understand blood glucose control and diabetes

## 9.1 Homeostasis

**Definition:** Maintenance of a constant internal environment

**What is regulated:**
- Body temperature
- Blood glucose concentration
- Water levels

**Control systems include:**
- Receptors (detect changes)
- Coordination centers (process information) - brain, spinal cord, pancreas
- Effectors (bring about responses) - muscles, glands

**Negative Feedback:**
- Response counteracts the change
- Returns system to optimum level

## 9.2 The Nervous System

**Structure:**
1. **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain and spinal cord
2. **Peripheral Nervous System:** Nerves connecting CNS to body

**Neuron Types:**
- **Sensory neurons:** Carry impulses from receptors to CNS
- **Relay neurons:** Connect sensory and motor neurons in CNS
- **Motor neurons:** Carry impulses from CNS to effectors

**Synapse:**
- Gap between neurons
- Impulse triggers release of chemical (neurotransmitter)
- Chemical diffuses across gap
- Triggers impulse in next neuron

## 9.3 Reflex Actions

**Purpose:** Rapid, automatic responses that don't involve conscious thought

**Reflex Arc:**
Stimulus → Receptor → Sensory neuron → Relay neuron (CNS) → Motor neuron → Effector → Response

**Example - Touching hot object:**
Heat receptor → sensory neuron → spinal cord → motor neuron → muscle → hand moves away

**Why reflexes are important:**
- Protect from danger
- Prevent injury
- Very fast (don't require thought)

**Required Practical:** Investigating reaction time using ruler drop test

## 9.4 The Brain

**Regions and Functions:**

| Region | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Cerebral cortex** | Consciousness, memory, language, intelligence |
| **Cerebellum** | Muscle coordination and balance |
| **Medulla** | Controls unconscious activities (heart rate, breathing) |

**Studying the Brain:**
- **MRI scans:** Detailed images of brain structure
- **CT scans:** X-ray images
- **PET scans:** Show brain activity
- **Electrical stimulation:** Map brain regions

**Treating brain disorders:**
- Difficult due to complexity
- Risk of damage
- Hard to access through skull

## 9.5 The Eye

**Structure and Function:**

| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Retina** | Contains light receptor cells (rods and cones) |
| **Optic nerve** | Carries impulses to brain |
| **Cornea** | Refracts (bends) light |
| **Lens** | Focuses light onto retina |
| **Iris** | Controls pupil size |
| **Pupil** | Hole that allows light in |
| **Ciliary muscles & suspensory ligaments** | Change lens shape |

**Accommodation (Focusing):**

**Near objects:**
- Ciliary muscles contract
- Suspensory ligaments loosen
- Lens becomes fat/more curved
- Refracts light more

**Distant objects:**
- Ciliary muscles relax
- Suspensory ligaments tighten
- Lens becomes thin/less curved
- Refracts light less

**Common Defects:**
- **Myopia (short-sighted):** Can't focus on distant objects; corrected with concave lens
- **Hyperopia (long-sighted):** Can't focus on near objects; corrected with convex lens

## 9.6 Control of Body Temperature

**Thermoregulation center:** In brain (hypothalamus)

**Too hot:**
- Sweat glands produce sweat (evaporation cools skin)
- Blood vessels dilate (vasodilation) - more blood near surface, more heat lost

**Too cold:**
- Shivering (muscles contract, releases energy)
- Blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) - less blood near surface, less heat lost
- Hairs stand up (goosebumps) - traps insulating air layer

## 9.7 The Endocrine System

**Hormones:**
- Chemical messengers
- Produced by glands
- Travel in blood
- Act on target organs
- Slower but longer-lasting than nervous system

**Major Glands:**

| Gland | Hormone | Function |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Pituitary** | Multiple (master gland) | Controls other glands |
| **Thyroid** | Thyroxine | Controls metabolic rate |
| **Pancreas** | Insulin, glucagon | Controls blood glucose |
| **Adrenal** | Adrenaline | Fight or flight response |
| **Ovaries** | Estrogen, progesterone | Menstrual cycle |
| **Testes** | Testosterone | Male characteristics |

## 9.8 Control of Blood Glucose

**Normal blood glucose:** ~90 mg/100 cm³

**Too high (after eating):**
1. Detected by pancreas
2. Pancreas releases **insulin**
3. Insulin causes glucose → glycogen in liver
4. Blood glucose decreases

**Too low (after exercise):**
1. Detected by pancreas
2. Pancreas releases **glucagon**
3. Glucagon causes glycogen → glucose in liver
4. Blood glucose increases

## 9.9 Diabetes

**Type 1 Diabetes:**
- Pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin
- Blood glucose can rise to dangerous levels
- Usually develops in childhood
- **Treatment:** Insulin injections, controlled diet

**Type 2 Diabetes:**
- Body stops responding to insulin
- Linked to obesity and lack of exercise
- Usually develops later in life
- **Treatment:** Controlled diet, exercise, weight loss

## Practice Questions

1. Define homeostasis
2. What is the role of receptors in homeostasis?
3. Name the three types of neurons
4. What is a synapse?
5. Why are reflexes important?
6. Which part of the brain controls balance?
7. What is the function of the iris?
8. How does the lens change shape for near objects?
9. Which hormone lowers blood glucose?
10. Compare Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes

## Key Points
✓ Homeostasis maintains constant internal environment
✓ Nervous system uses electrical impulses (fast)
✓ Endocrine system uses hormones in blood (slower, longer-lasting)
✓ Reflex actions are rapid, automatic responses
✓ Brain has regions for different functions
✓ Eyes focus by changing lens shape (accommodation)
✓ Insulin lowers blood glucose; glucagon raises it
✓ Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin injections
