## 1.1 Animal and Plant Cells

### Eukaryotic Cells

Both animal and plant cells are **eukaryotic** (have a nucleus).

**Subcellular structures in BOTH animal and plant cells:**

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Nucleus** | Contains genetic material (DNA) that controls the cell |
| **Cytoplasm** | Gel-like substance where chemical reactions happen |
| **Cell membrane** | Controls what enters and leaves the cell |
| **Mitochondria** | Site of aerobic respiration (releases energy) |
| **Ribosomes** | Site of protein synthesis |

**EXTRA structures in PLANT cells only:**

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Cell wall** | Made of cellulose, provides support and structure |
| **Chloroplasts** | Contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis |
| **Permanent vacuole** | Contains cell sap, helps maintain cell structure |

### Prokaryotic Cells (Bacteria)

Much simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells.

**Key features:**
- No nucleus (DNA floats freely as a circular chromosome)
- Additional small rings of DNA called **plasmids**
- Cell wall (but not made of cellulose)
- No mitochondria or chloroplasts
- Much smaller (typically 0.2-2.0 μm)

## 1.2 Specialized Cells

Cells are adapted for specific functions.

### Sperm Cell
- **Function:** Fertilize an egg
- **Adaptations:**
  - Long tail for swimming
  - Lots of mitochondria for energy
  - Acrosome contains enzymes to digest egg membrane
  - Streamlined head

### Egg Cell (Ovum)
- **Function:** Be fertilized and nourish developing embryo
- **Adaptations:**
  - Large cell with cytoplasm full of nutrients
  - Cell membrane changes after fertilization to prevent more sperm entering
  - Haploid nucleus

### Ciliated Epithelial Cell
- **Function:** Move mucus in respiratory tract
- **Adaptations:**
  - Tiny hair-like cilia on surface
  - Cilia beat in rhythm to move mucus

### Red Blood Cell (Erythrocyte)
- **Function:** Transport oxygen
- **Adaptations:**
  - Biconcave disc shape (large surface area)
  - No nucleus (more space for hemoglobin)
  - Contains hemoglobin (binds to oxygen)
  - Flexible to squeeze through capillaries

### Nerve Cell (Neuron)
- **Function:** Carry electrical impulses
- **Adaptations:**
  - Long axon to carry impulses long distances
  - Branched dendrites to connect to other neurons
  - Myelin sheath insulates axon
  - Synapses for communication

### Root Hair Cell
- **Function:** Absorb water and minerals from soil
- **Adaptations:**
  - Long "hair" increases surface area
  - Large vacuole for water storage
  - Thin cell wall for easy absorption
  - No chloroplasts (underground)

### Xylem Cell

## 1.3 Microscopy

### Using a Light Microscope

**Method:**
1. Place slide on stage
2. Select lowest power objective lens
3. Use coarse focus to bring slide into view
4. Use fine focus for clear image
5. Increase magnification if needed

**Magnification formula:**

**Total magnification = Eyepiece lens × Objective lens**

**Example:** Eyepiece ×10, objective ×40
- Total = 10 × 40 = **×400**

### Calculating Size

**Magnification = Image size / Real size**

Rearranged:
- **Real size = Image size / Magnification**
- **Image size = Real size × Magnification**

**Example:** A cell appears 5 mm under ×100 magnification. Find real size.

Solution:
- Real size = 5 mm / 100 = 0.05 mm = **50 μm**

### Electron Microscopy (Higher Tier)

**Advantages over light microscopes:**
- Much higher magnification (up to ×2,000,000)
- Higher resolution (can see smaller structures)
- Can see internal structures like mitochondria in detail

**Types:**
- **TEM (Transmission):** 2D images, very high resolution
- **SEM (Scanning):** 3D images of surfaces

## 1.4 Diffusion

**Definition:** The spreading out of particles from an area of HIGH concentration to an area of LOW concentration (down a concentration gradient).

**Examples:**
- Oxygen diffusing into cells for respiration
- Carbon dioxide diffusing out of cells
- Smell of perfume spreading through a room

### Factors Affecting Rate of Diffusion

1. **Concentration gradient:** Greater difference = faster diffusion
2. **Temperature:** Higher temperature = faster diffusion (particles move faster)
3. **Surface area:** Larger surface = faster diffusion

**Fick's Law (Higher Tier):**

Rate of diffusion ∝ (Surface area × Concentration gradient) / Thickness of membrane

---

## 1.5 Osmosis

**Definition:** The diffusion of WATER molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of HIGH water concentration (dilute solution) to LOW water concentration (concentrated solution).

**Key points:**
- Special type of diffusion
- Only involves water molecules
- Requires partially permeable membrane
- Water moves to dilute the more concentrated solution

### Osmosis in Cells

**Animal cells:**
- In pure water: Cell swells and may burst (lysis)
- In concentrated solution: Cell shrinks (crenation)

**Plant cells:**
- In pure water: Cell becomes turgid (swollen, firm) - cell wall prevents bursting
- In concentrated solution: Cell becomes flaccid (limp), then plasmolysed (cytoplasm pulls away from cell wall)

**Required Practical:** Investigating osmosis using potato cylinders in different concentrations of sugar solution.

---

## 1.6 Active Transport

**Definition:** The movement of substances from a LOW concentration to a HIGH concentration (against the concentration gradient) using ENERGY from respiration.

**Key differences from diffusion:**
- Goes AGAINST concentration gradient
- Requires ENERGY (from mitochondria)
- Uses carrier proteins in cell membrane

**Examples:**
- Root hair cells absorbing minerals from soil (low concentration in soil)
- Sugar molecules being absorbed from gut into blood (even when concentration is low in gut)
- Nerve cells pumping ions to maintain electrical charge
