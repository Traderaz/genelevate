## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Earth's Resources

### Natural Resources

**Definition:** Materials from Earth that humans use

**Types:**

**Renewable:**
- Can be replaced/regenerated
- Won't run out
- Examples: Wood, wind, solar energy

**Finite (Non-renewable):**
- Will run out
- Can't be replaced once used
- Examples: Fossil fuels, metal ores, minerals

---

**Definition:** Meeting needs of current population without compromising future generations

**Involves:**
- Using resources efficiently
- Reducing waste
- Recycling
- Using renewable resources
- Protecting environment

---

### Synthetic vs Natural

**Natural products:** Found in nature
- Examples: Cotton, wool, wood, natural rubber

**Synthetic products:** Made by chemical processes
- Examples: Plastics, synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon)

**Agriculture provides:**
- Food
- Fuel (biofuels)
- Clothing (cotton, wool)
- Building materials (wood)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Potable Water ‚≠ê

### What Is Potable Water?

**Potable water:** Water safe to drink

**Requirements:**
- Low levels of dissolved salts
- Low levels of microbes
- pH 6.5-8.5 (around neutral)

**NOT pure water** (pure H‚ÇÇO has no dissolved substances)

---

### Sources of Fresh Water

**UK:**
- Rain provides fresh water
- Collects in rivers, lakes, reservoirs
- Low salt content

**Other countries:**
- May need desalination (remove salt from seawater)
- More expensive process

---

### Making Water Potable (UK Method)

**Process:**

**1. Screening**
- Remove large objects (leaves, twigs)
- Use wire mesh/grids

**2. Sedimentation**
- Water stands in tanks
- Heavier particles (sediment) sink to bottom
- Sometimes chemicals added to make particles clump

**3. Filtration**
- Water passed through filter beds (sand/gravel)
- Removes smaller particles

**4. Chlorination**
- Chlorine gas added
- Kills bacteria/microbes
- Makes water safe to drink

**Alternative to chlorine:**
- UV light (kills microbes)
- Ozone (O‚ÇÉ)

---

### Desalination

**Why needed:**
- Some countries have limited fresh water
- Must use seawater

**Two methods:**

**1. Distillation**
- Heat seawater to boiling
- Water evaporates
- Condense vapor
- Collect pure water
- **Very expensive** (high energy costs)

**2. Reverse Osmosis**
- Force water through membrane
- Salt ions can't pass through
- Pure water collected
- **Expensive** (requires pressure)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Water Treatment ‚≠ê

### Sources of Waste Water

- Toilets and bathrooms
- Kitchens
- Industrial processes
- Agricultural runoff

**Contains:**
- Organic matter
- Harmful microbes
- Chemicals

---

### Sewage Treatment Process

**1. Screening**
- Remove large objects/debris
- Use grids/mesh

**2. Sedimentation**
- Heavier solids sink (sludge)
- Effluent (liquid) remains on top

**3. Aerobic biological treatment**
- Air bubbled through effluent
- Aerobic bacteria break down organic matter
- Bacteria need oxygen for respiration

**4. Final treatments**
- Further sedimentation
- Chlorination to kill remaining microbes
- Water safe to return to rivers

**What happens to sludge:**
- Can be digested by **anaerobic bacteria**
- Produces methane gas (used as fuel)
- Remaining sludge can be used as fertilizer

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ‚≠ê

### What Is LCA?

**Life Cycle Assessment:** Evaluating environmental impact of a product throughout its life

### Four Stages

**1. Extracting/Processing Raw Materials**
- Mining/drilling
- Damage to landscape
- Energy use
- Pollution

**2. Manufacturing**
- Energy use
- Waste products
- Pollution (air, water)
- Transport

**3. Using the Product**
- Energy consumption during use
- Maintenance
- Emissions

**4. Disposal**
- Landfill space
- Incineration (pollution)
- Recycling (energy use)

---

### Comparing Products - Example

**Paper Bag vs Plastic Bag:**

| Stage | Paper | Plastic |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Raw materials** | Trees (renewable) | Crude oil (finite) |
| **Manufacturing** | More energy, more water | Less energy |
| **Transport** | Heavier (more fuel) | Lighter |
| **Use** | Single use often | Can reuse many times |
| **Disposal** | Biodegradable | Not biodegradable, but recyclable |

**Conclusion:** Depends on circumstances!
- If reused many times: plastic better
- If single use: paper might be better

---

### Problems with LCAs

**Difficulties:**
- **Selective** - companies may choose what to include
- **Quantitative data** easy (energy, water) but **qualitative** hard (pollution impact)
- Different interpretations
- Subjective judgments
- Based on assumptions
- Time-consuming and expensive

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Recycling and Resource Management

### Why Recycle?

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Conserves finite resources (metals, crude oil)
‚úÖ Reduces landfill waste
‚úÖ Less energy than extracting new materials
‚úÖ Reduces environmental damage
‚úÖ Economic benefits (creates jobs)

---

### Metals

**Why recycle metals:**
- Extracting from ores uses lots of energy
- Limited metal ores available
- Recycling uses less energy
- Copper, aluminum especially worth recycling

**Aluminum recycling:**
- Uses only 5% of energy compared to extraction
- Can be recycled indefinitely
- No loss of quality

---

### Glass

**Recycling glass:**
- Crushed and melted
- Made into new glass products
- Can be recycled infinitely
- Uses less energy than making from raw materials

---

### Plastics

**Challenges:**
- Many different types
- Need to be separated
- Some hard to recycle
- Lower quality after recycling

**Solutions:**
- Better sorting systems
- Biodegradable plastics
- Reduce usage

---

### Reducing Resource Use

**The 3 Rs:**

**1. REDUCE**
- Use less
- Choose products with less packaging
- Avoid single-use items

**2. REUSE**
- Use items multiple times
- Repair instead of replace
- Refillable containers

**3. RECYCLE**
- Process materials into new products
- Keeps materials in use
- Reduces waste

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Corrosion ‚≠ê

### What Is Corrosion?

**Corrosion:** Destruction of materials by chemical reactions with environment

**For metals:** Oxidation reaction

### Rusting of Iron

**Conditions needed:**
- Water (moisture)
- Oxygen (from air)

**Both needed** - neither alone causes rust

**Equation:**
```
Iron + oxygen + water ‚Üí hydrated iron(III) oxide
(rust)
```

**Rust is:**
- Soft
- Flaky
- Orange-brown
- Permeable (lets water through)
- Weakens structure

---

### Preventing Rust

**1. Barrier Methods**

**Painting:**
- Stops water and oxygen reaching iron
- If scratched, rusting starts underneath

**Oiling/Greasing:**
- Thin layer prevents contact
- Needs regular reapplication

**Plastic coating:**
- Complete barrier
- Durable

---

**2. Galvanizing**

- Coating iron with zinc
- Zinc more reactive than iron
- Zinc corrodes instead of iron (**sacrificial protection**)
- Even if scratched, iron still protected

**How it works:**
- Zinc oxidizes preferentially
- Uses up oxygen before it reaches iron
- Zinc sacrificed to protect iron

**Uses:**
- Galvanized steel (roofs, gates, buckets)

---

**3. Alloying**

**Stainless Steel:**
- Iron + Chromium (+ sometimes Nickel)
- Chromium forms protective oxide layer
- Doesn't rust
- More expensive

**Uses:**
- Cutlery
- Sinks
- Surgical instruments

---

**4. Sacrificial Protection**

- Attach more reactive metal to iron
- Reactive metal corrodes instead
- Iron protected

**Example:**
- Magnesium blocks on ship hulls
- Zinc blocks on underground pipes

---

### Alloys (Reminder)

**Alloy:** Mixture of metals (or metal + non-metal)

**Properties:**
- Harder than pure metals
- Different sized atoms disrupt layers
- Layers can't slide easily

**Common alloys:**

| Alloy | Composition | Uses |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Steel | Iron + Carbon | Construction, cars |
| Stainless steel | Iron + Chromium + Nickel | Cutlery, sinks |
| Brass | Copper + Zinc | Musical instruments, door handles |
| Bronze | Copper + Tin | Statues, medals |
