## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Evolution of the Atmosphere

### Phase 1: Early Atmosphere (4.6 billion years ago)

**Volcanic Activity:**
- Earth's surface was molten
- Intense volcanic activity
- Volcanoes released gases

**Composition:**
- Mainly **carbon dioxide** (like Mars/Venus today)
- **Water vapor** (from volcanoes)
- Small amounts of **methane** and **ammonia**
- Very little/no **oxygen**

**Formation of oceans:**
- Earth cooled down
- Water vapor condensed
- Formed oceans

---

### Phase 2: Oxygen Appears (2.7 billion years ago)

**Algae and Plants:**
- First photosynthetic organisms evolved (algae)
- Later, plants evolved
- **Photosynthesis** began

**Photosynthesis equation:**
```
6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ
(carbon dioxide + water ‚Üí glucose + oxygen)
```

**Effects:**
- **Oxygen levels increased**
- **Carbon dioxide levels decreased**
- Oxygen allowed more complex life to evolve

---

### Phase 3: Ozone Layer Forms

**What happened:**
- Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) reached upper atmosphere
- UV radiation split O‚ÇÇ into oxygen atoms
- Oxygen atoms combined: O + O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí O‚ÇÉ (ozone)

**Importance of ozone layer:**
- Blocks harmful UV radiation
- Allowed life to move onto land
- Protected organisms from UV damage

---

### Phase 4: Modern Atmosphere

**Current composition:**

| Gas | Percentage |
|-----|------------|
| Nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) | 78% |
| Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) | 21% |
| Argon (Ar) | 0.9% |
| Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) | 0.04% |
| Water vapor + other gases | trace amounts |

**How CO‚ÇÇ decreased:**
1. **Dissolved in oceans**
2. **Used in photosynthesis**
3. **Locked in fossil fuels** (dead organisms compressed)
4. **Locked in sedimentary rocks** (e.g., limestone - CaCO‚ÇÉ)

**How N‚ÇÇ increased:**
- Ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ) from volcanoes reacted with oxygen
- Released nitrogen gas
- Nitrogen unreactive, so built up

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Greenhouse Effect ‚≠ê

### Natural Greenhouse Effect

**How it works:**
1. Sun emits **short wavelength radiation** (UV, visible light)
2. Passes through atmosphere
3. Earth absorbs energy, warms up
4. Earth emits **long wavelength radiation** (infrared/heat)
5. **Greenhouse gases** absorb infrared radiation
6. Re-radiate energy in all directions (including back to Earth)
7. Keeps Earth warm

**Without greenhouse effect:**
- Earth would be about -18¬∞C
- Too cold for life as we know it

---

### Greenhouse Gases

| Gas | Source |
|-----|--------|
| **Water vapor (H‚ÇÇO)** | Evaporation from oceans |
| **Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)** | Respiration, combustion, deforestation |
| **Methane (CH‚ÇÑ)** | Cattle, rice fields, landfills |
| **Nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO)** | Fertilizers, vehicle engines |

**Note:** Nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) and oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) are NOT greenhouse gases!

---

### Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

**Human activities increasing greenhouse gases:**

**1. Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ):**
- Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
- Deforestation (fewer trees to absorb CO‚ÇÇ)

**2. Methane (CH‚ÇÑ):**
- Cattle farming (cow digestion)
- Rice paddy fields
- Landfill sites (decomposing waste)

**3. Nitrous Oxide (N‚ÇÇO):**
- Fertilizers in agriculture
- Vehicle emissions

**Result:**
- More greenhouse gases
- More infrared radiation absorbed
- Earth getting warmer
- **Global warming** / **Climate change**

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Climate Change ‚≠ê

### Evidence for Climate Change

**Temperature records:**
- Average global temperature rising
- Last century: +1¬∞C increase
- Accelerating in recent decades

**Ice core data:**
- Bubbles in ancient ice contain air samples
- Show CO‚ÇÇ levels over 800,000 years
- CO‚ÇÇ higher now than any time in that period

**Other evidence:**
- Melting ice caps and glaciers
- Rising sea levels
- Changing weather patterns

---

### Effects of Climate Change

**Environmental:**
- **Sea level rise** (flooding of low-lying areas)
- **Extreme weather** (more storms, droughts, floods)
- **Ice caps melting** (habitat loss for polar animals)
- **Ocean acidification** (CO‚ÇÇ dissolves, damages coral)
- **Species extinction** (can't adapt fast enough)
- **Migration patterns change**

**Human impacts:**
- Crop failures (droughts/floods)
- Water scarcity
- Spread of tropical diseases
- Displacement of people (climate refugees)
- Economic damage

---

### Uncertainty in Climate Science

**Why difficult to predict:**
- Climate is complex system
- Many interacting factors
- Long time scales
- Computer models not perfect
- Natural variation occurs anyway

**However:**
- Scientific consensus: humans are causing current warming
- Evidence is overwhelming
- Action needed urgently

---

```

**Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen):**
```
Hydrocarbon + oxygen ‚Üí carbon monoxide + water
2CH‚ÇÑ + 3O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2CO + 4H‚ÇÇO
