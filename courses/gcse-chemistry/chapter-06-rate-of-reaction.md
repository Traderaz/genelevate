## 1️⃣ Rate of Reaction

### Definition
**Rate of reaction:** How fast reactants turn into products

### How to Measure

**Faster reaction = More product made in shorter time**

**Methods:**
1. **Volume of gas produced** - use gas syringe
2. **Mass change** - weigh on balance (if gas escapes)
3. **Time for solution to go cloudy** - precipitation reaction
4. **Color change** - clock reactions

### Typical Rates Graph

```
Amount of    │     ──────── Reaction finished
Product      │    ╱          (plateau)
             │   ╱
             │  ╱  ← Steepest = fastest rate
             │ ╱
             │╱
             └────────────────────→
                    Time
```

**Key points:**
- Steepest slope = fastest rate
- Flat line = reaction finished
- All reactant used up

---

## 2️⃣ Collision Theory ⭐

### The Rule
**For a reaction to occur:**
1. Particles must **collide**
2. With **enough energy** (activation energy)

### Successful Collision
```
Reactant A  +  Reactant B  →  Product
    ●           ●              ●
    └───────────┘              (if enough energy)
     Collision
```

### Unsuccessful Collision
- Particles collide but bounce apart
- Not enough energy
- No reaction

---

## 3️⃣ Factors Affecting Rate ⭐

### Summary Table

| Factor | Effect | Why (Collision Theory) |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| ↑ Concentration | ↑ Rate | More particles, more collisions |
| ↑ Temperature | ↑ Rate | Particles move faster, collide more often with more energy |
| ↑ Surface Area | ↑ Rate | More particles exposed, more collisions |
| Catalyst | ↑ Rate | Lowers activation energy, more successful collisions |

---

### 1. Concentration (Solutions)

**Higher concentration → Faster reaction**

**Why?**
- More particles in same volume
- Particles closer together
- Collide more frequently
- More collisions per second
- **Increased rate**

**Graph Effect:**
```
Volume    │  High concentration
of gas    │     ╱───── (same final amount)
          │    ╱
          │   ╱╱ Low concentration
          │  ╱╱
          │ ╱╱
          └────────────→
               Time
```

---

### 2. Pressure (Gases)

**Higher pressure → Faster reaction**

**Why?**
- Same as concentration
- More gas particles in same volume
- More frequent collisions
- **Increased rate**

---

### 3. Temperature ⭐

**Higher temperature → MUCH faster reaction**

**Why?**
- Particles have more **kinetic energy**
- Move faster
- Collide **more frequently**
- More importantly: **more particles have energy ≥ activation energy**
- Many more **successful collisions**
- **Greatly increased rate**

**Important:** Even small temperature increase (10°C) can double the rate!

**Graph Effect:**
```
Volume    │  High temp
of gas    │   ╱────
          │  ╱
          │ ╱╱  Low temp
          │ ╱╱
          │╱╱
          └────────────→
               Time
```

---

### 4. Surface Area

**Larger surface area → Faster reaction**

**Example:** Powder reacts faster than large chunks

**Why?**
- More particles exposed at surface
- More particles available to collide
- More collisions per second
- **Increased rate**

**Visual:**
```
Large cube:        Powder:
  [■]         vs   ● ● ● ●
Small surface      Large total surface
```

**Graph Effect:**
```
Volume    │  Powder
of gas    │   ╱──── (same final amount)
          │  ╱
          │ ╱╱ Lumps
          │ ╱╱
          │╱╱
          └────────────→
               Time
```

---

### 5. Catalysts ⭐

**Catalyst:** Substance that speeds up reaction WITHOUT being used up

**Key Features:**
- Speeds up reaction
- Not used up (can be recovered)
- Only small amount needed
- Lowers activation energy

**How it works:**
- Provides alternative pathway
- With lower activation energy
- More particles have enough energy
- More successful collisions

**Examples:**
- Iron in Haber process (making ammonia)
- Platinum in catalytic converters
- Enzymes (biological catalysts)

---

## 4️⃣ Measuring Rates - Required Practicals

### Method 1: Gas Volume

**Apparatus:**
- Conical flask
- Gas syringe or upturned measuring cylinder
- Stop clock

**Method:**
1. Add reactants to flask
2. Quickly attach gas syringe
3. Record volume of gas every 10 seconds
4. Plot graph

**Example reaction:**
```
Marble chips + hydrochloric acid → CO₂ gas
CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂
```

**Variables to test:**
- Concentration of acid
- Size of marble chips (surface area)
- Temperature

---

### Method 2: Mass Change

**Apparatus:**
- Balance
- Cotton wool (to let gas escape but prevent spray)
- Conical flask
- Stop clock

**Method:**
1. Place flask on balance
2. Add reactants
3. Record mass every 10 seconds
4. Mass decreases as gas escapes

**Why cotton wool?**
- Lets gas escape
- Prevents acid spray
- Allows accurate mass readings

---

### Method 3: Precipitation

**Example:** Sodium thiosulfate + acid

**Method:**
1. Place flask on paper with X marked
2. Add reactants
3. Look down through flask
4. Time how long until X disappears

**Less accurate because:**
- Subjective (different people judge differently)
- Only gives one time value
- Can't plot a graph

---

## 5️⃣ Calculating Rate from Graphs ⭐

### Mean Rate of Reaction

```
Rate = amount of product formed
       ────────────────────────
              time taken

OR

Rate = amount of reactant used
       ────────────────────────
              time taken
```

### Example 1
48 cm³ of gas produced in 20 seconds.

```
Rate = 48 ÷ 20 = 2.4 cm³/s
```

### Example 2
3g of reactant used up in 30 seconds.

```
Rate = 3 ÷ 30 = 0.1 g/s
```

---

### Rate at Specific Time (Gradient) - Higher

**Method:**
1. Draw tangent to curve at that time
2. Calculate gradient of tangent

```
Gradient = change in y
           ──────────
           change in x
```

**Example:**
```
Volume    │  
of gas    │     ●  (60, 40)
 (cm³)    │    ╱│
          │   ╱ │ 30 cm³
       40 │  ╱  │
          │ ╱   │
       10 │╱____│
          └─────●──────→
          10    40    Time (s)
                30 s

Gradient = 30 ÷ 30 = 1 cm³/s
```

---

## 6️⃣ Reversible Reactions (Higher) ⭐

### Definition
**Reversible reaction:** Products can react to form reactants again

**Symbol:** ⇌ (not just →)

### Example
```
Ammonium chloride ⇌ ammonia + hydrogen chloride
NH₄Cl(s) ⇌ NH₃(g) + HCl(g)
```

**Forward reaction:** NH₄Cl → NH₃ + HCl (endothermic)
**Reverse reaction:** NH₃ + HCl → NH₄Cl (exothermic)

### Key Rule
**If forward reaction is endothermic, reverse is exothermic**
(and vice versa)

---

## 7️⃣ Equilibrium (Higher) ⭐

### Definition
**Dynamic equilibrium:** Rate of forward reaction = Rate of reverse reaction

**Key features:**
- Concentrations stay constant
- Both reactions still happening
- Only in **closed system** (nothing can enter/leave)

### Example: Color Changes

```
Hydrated copper sulfate ⇌ Anhydrous copper sulfate + water
    CuSO₄·5H₂O       ⇌       CuSO₄           + 5H₂O
      (blue)                  (white)

Heat: Blue → White (forward, endothermic)
Add water: White → Blue (reverse, exothermic)
```

---

## 8️⃣ Le Chatelier's Principle (Higher) ⭐

### The Principle
**If conditions change, equilibrium shifts to oppose the change**

### Effects of Changing Conditions

#### 1. Concentration

**Increase concentration of reactant:**
- Equilibrium shifts RIGHT
- Makes more products
- To remove extra reactant

**Increase concentration of product:**
- Equilibrium shifts LEFT
- Makes more reactants
- To remove extra product

---

#### 2. Temperature

**Increase temperature:**
- Equilibrium shifts to **endothermic** direction
- To absorb extra heat

**Decrease temperature:**
- Equilibrium shifts to **exothermic** direction
- To release more heat

**Example:**
```
N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃  (forward = exothermic)

Increase temp: Shifts LEFT (less ammonia)
Decrease temp: Shifts RIGHT (more ammonia)
```

---

#### 3. Pressure (Gases Only)

**Increase pressure:**
- Equilibrium shifts to side with **fewer gas molecules**
- To reduce pressure

**Example:**
```
N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)
4 molecules    ⇌   2 molecules

Increase pressure: Shifts RIGHT (fewer molecules)
```

---

#### 4. Catalyst

**Catalysts:**
- Speed up forward AND reverse reactions equally
- Do NOT change position of equilibrium
- Just reach equilibrium faster

---

### Haber Process Example ⭐

**Reaction:**
```
N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)  ΔH = -92 kJ/mol
                         (exothermic)
```

**Conditions used:**
- Temperature: 450°C
- Pressure: 200 atmospheres
- Catalyst: Iron

**Why these conditions:**

| Condition | Why | Compromise |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| High pressure | Shifts right (fewer molecules), more NH₃ | Very high pressure = expensive equipment |
| 450°C (moderate) | Forward is exothermic, so low temp better BUT reaction too slow at low temp | 450°C = reasonable rate + reasonable yield |
| Iron catalyst | Speeds up reaction | Doesn't change yield, but reaches equilibrium faster |
