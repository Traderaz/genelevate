## 1️⃣ Relative Formula Mass (Mr) ⭐

### Definition
The sum of the relative atomic masses (Ar) of all atoms in a formula

### Method
1. Write down the formula
2. Look up Ar values (given in exam)
3. Multiply Ar by number of atoms
4. Add them all up

### Example 1: Water (H₂O)
- H: 1 × 2 = 2
- O: 16 × 1 = 16
- **Mr = 18**

### Example 2: Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
- C: 12 × 1 = 12
- O: 16 × 2 = 32
- **Mr = 44**

### Example 3: Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)
- Ca: 40 × 1 = 40
- C: 12 × 1 = 12
- O: 16 × 3 = 48
- **Mr = 100**

### Example 4: Magnesium Hydroxide Mg(OH)₂
**Watch the brackets!**
- Mg: 24 × 1 = 24
- O: 16 × 2 = 32 (multiply by 2 because of bracket)
- H: 1 × 2 = 2 (multiply by 2 because of bracket)
- **Mr = 58**

**Common Mistake:** Forgetting to multiply everything in brackets!

---

## 2️⃣ Conservation of Mass ⭐

### The Law
**In a chemical reaction, mass is never created or destroyed**

Total mass of reactants = Total mass of products

### Why Mass Seems to Change

**Mass appears to increase:**
- If a gas from air reacts with a substance
- Example: Magnesium burning → gains oxygen from air
- 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

**Mass appears to decrease:**
- If a gas is produced and escapes
- Example: Calcium carbonate + acid → CO₂ escapes
- The mass LOOKS like it decreased, but the gas still has mass!

### Balancing Equations from Mass

**Example:** When heated, 2g of hydrogen reacts with 16g of oxygen to make water. How much water is produced?

```
Mass of reactants = 2 + 16 = 18g
Mass of products = 18g (conservation of mass)
So 18g of water is produced
```

---

## 3️⃣ Moles (The Mole Concept) ⭐

### What is a Mole?
**A mole is:** 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's constant)

**Like:** A dozen = 12, A mole = 6.02 × 10²³

**One mole of any substance contains the same number of particles**

### Molar Mass
**Molar mass = relative formula mass in grams**

| Substance | Mr | Molar Mass |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| H₂O | 18 | 18 g/mol |
| CO₂ | 44 | 44 g/mol |
| NaCl | 58.5 | 58.5 g/mol |
| CaCO₃ | 100 | 100 g/mol |

### The Mole Formula Triangle ⭐

```
       mass (g)
      ──────────
      |        |
      | moles  |  ×  Mr
      |        |
      ──────────

mass = moles × Mr
moles = mass ÷ Mr
Mr = mass ÷ moles
```

**LEARN THIS TRIANGLE! Used in almost every calculation!**

### Example Calculations

**Example 1:** Calculate the number of moles in 20g of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)

```
Mr of CaCO₃ = 40 + 12 + (16×3) = 100

moles = mass ÷ Mr
      = 20 ÷ 100
      = 0.2 moles
```

**Example 2:** Calculate the mass of 0.5 moles of water (H₂O)

```
Mr of H₂O = (1×2) + 16 = 18

mass = moles × Mr
     = 0.5 × 18
     = 9g
```

**Example 3:** 44g of carbon dioxide contains how many moles?

```
Mr of CO₂ = 12 + (16×2) = 44

moles = mass ÷ Mr
      = 44 ÷ 44
      = 1 mole
```

## 4️⃣ Using Moles in Equations ⭐ (Higher)

### Balanced Equations Tell Us Mole Ratios

**Example:** 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

**Ratio:** 2 moles : 1 mole : 2 moles

### Calculation Steps
1. Write balanced equation
2. Find mole ratio
3. Calculate moles of given substance
4. Use ratio to find moles of unknown
5. Convert back to mass if needed

### Worked Example 1

**Question:** What mass of magnesium oxide is produced when 12g of magnesium burns in oxygen?

**Equation:** 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

**Step 1:** Ar values: Mg = 24, O = 16

**Step 2:** Calculate moles of Mg
```
moles = mass ÷ Ar
      = 12 ÷ 24
      = 0.5 moles
```

**Step 3:** Use equation ratio
```
2Mg → 2MgO
Ratio 2:2 = 1:1

So 0.5 moles Mg → 0.5 moles MgO
```

**Step 4:** Calculate mass of MgO
```
Mr of MgO = 24 + 16 = 40

mass = moles × Mr
     = 0.5 × 40
     = 20g
```

**Answer: 20g of MgO produced**

### Worked Example 2

**Question:** Calculate the mass of water produced when 4g of hydrogen reacts with excess oxygen.

**Equation:** 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

**Step 1:** Mr of H₂ = 2, Mr of H₂O = 18

**Step 2:** Moles of H₂
```
moles = 4 ÷ 2 = 2 moles
```

**Step 3:** Ratio 2H₂ : 2H₂O = 1:1
```
2 moles H₂ → 2 moles H₂O
```

**Step 4:** Mass of H₂O
```
mass = 2 × 18 = 36g
```

**Answer: 36g of water**

---

## 5️⃣ Limiting Reactants (Higher)

### Definition
**Limiting reactant:** The reactant that is completely used up (limits the amount of product)

**Excess reactant:** The reactant left over

### How to Identify

**Example:** 10g of magnesium reacts with 10g of oxygen. Which is the limiting reactant?

**Equation:** 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

**Step 1:** Calculate moles of each
```
Moles of Mg = 10 ÷ 24 = 0.42 moles
Moles of O₂ = 10 ÷ 32 = 0.31 moles
```

**Step 2:** Check the ratio (2Mg : 1O₂)
```
0.42 moles Mg needs 0.42 ÷ 2 = 0.21 moles O₂
We have 0.31 moles O₂

Mg runs out first → Mg is limiting reactant
```

**Calculate product based on limiting reactant only!**

---

## 6️⃣ Concentration of Solutions ⭐

### Definition
**Concentration:** Amount of solute dissolved in a given volume of solution

### Units
- **g/dm³** (grams per cubic decimeter)
- **mol/dm³** (moles per cubic decimeter) - Higher tier

**Note:** 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³ = 1 litre

### Formula Triangle

```
        mass (g)
      ────────────
      |          |
      |  conc.   | × volume
      | (g/dm³)  |   (dm³)
      ────────────

concentration = mass ÷ volume
mass = concentration × volume
volume = mass ÷ concentration
```

### Conversions You Need
```
cm³ → dm³: divide by 1000
dm³ → cm³: multiply by 1000

Example: 500 cm³ = 0.5 dm³
Example: 0.25 dm³ = 250 cm³
```

### Example Calculations

**Example 1:** 20g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 500 cm³ of water. Calculate the concentration in g/dm³.

```
Step 1: Convert volume
500 cm³ = 500 ÷ 1000 = 0.5 dm³

Step 2: Calculate concentration
concentration = mass ÷ volume
              = 20 ÷ 0.5
              = 40 g/dm³
```

**Example 2:** What mass of sugar is in 250 cm³ of a solution with concentration 80 g/dm³?

```
Step 1: Convert volume
250 cm³ = 0.25 dm³

Step 2: Calculate mass
mass = concentration × volume
     = 80 × 0.25
     = 20g
```

### Molar Concentration (Higher) ⭐

**Formula:**
```
concentration (mol/dm³) = moles ÷ volume (dm³)
```

**Example:** 0.1 moles of HCl in 500 cm³. Find concentration.

```
Volume = 500 cm³ = 0.5 dm³

concentration = 0.1 ÷ 0.5
              = 0.2 mol/dm³
```

---

## 7️⃣ Percentage Yield (Higher) ⭐

### Definition
**Theoretical yield:** Maximum amount of product possible (from calculations)

**Actual yield:** Amount of product actually obtained

### Formula

```
                    actual yield
percentage yield = ───────────── × 100%
                  theoretical yield
```

### Why Yield is Less Than 100%

1. **Reversible reactions** - products react back to reactants
2. **Side reactions** - other reactions occur
3. **Practical losses** - product left in equipment, spills
4. **Incomplete reactions** - not all reactants react

### Example Calculation

**Question:** Theory predicts 50g of copper sulfate. A student obtains 40g. Calculate percentage yield.

```
percentage yield = (40 ÷ 50) × 100
                 = 0.8 × 100
                 = 80%
```

**Exam Tip:** Always show the division first, then multiply by 100!

## 8️⃣ Atom Economy (Higher) ⭐

### Definition
Measures what percentage of reactant atoms become useful products

### Formula

```
                    Mr of desired product
atom economy = ─────────────────────────────── × 100%
               total Mr of all reactants
```

### Example 1: Making Copper

**Reaction:** CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O

**Desired product:** Cu (Ar = 64)

**Reactants:** CuO (Mr = 80) + H₂ (Mr = 2) = 82 total

```
atom economy = (64 ÷ 82) × 100
             = 78%
```

### Example 2: Making Ammonia

**Reaction:** N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃

**Desired product:** 2NH₃ = 2 × 17 = 34

**Reactants:** N₂ (28) + 3H₂ (6) = 34 total

```
atom economy = (34 ÷ 34) × 100
             = 100%
```

**Perfect atom economy - no waste products!**

### Why High Atom Economy is Important

✅ Less waste produced  
✅ More sustainable  
✅ More cost-effective  
✅ Better for environment  

**Lower** atom economy = more waste = worse for economy and environment

## 9️⃣ Balancing Equations ⭐

### Rules
1. Count atoms on each side
2. Add numbers in FRONT of formulae only
3. Never change formulae themselves
4. Check all atoms balance

### Method - Step by Step

**Example:** Balance: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O

**Step 1:** Count atoms
- Left: H = 2, O = 2
- Right: H = 2, O = 1

**Step 2:** Balance oxygen (odd one out)
```
H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
```
Now: Left O = 2, Right O = 2 ✓
But: Left H = 2, Right H = 4 ✗

**Step 3:** Balance hydrogen
```
2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
```

**Step 4:** Check all atoms
- H: Left = 4, Right = 4 ✓
- O: Left = 2, Right = 2 ✓

**Answer: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O**

### Common Equations to Practice

1. Mg + O₂ → MgO  
   **Answer:** 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

## 🔟 Gas Volume Calculations (Higher)

### Key Facts
At room temperature and pressure (RTP):
- **1 mole of any gas = 24 dm³ (24,000 cm³)**

### Formula

```
volume (dm³) = moles × 24
moles = volume ÷ 24
```

### Example 1
**Calculate the volume of 2 moles of CO₂ at RTP**

```
volume = moles × 24
       = 2 × 24
       = 48 dm³
```

### Example 2
**How many moles in 120 dm³ of oxygen at RTP?**

```
moles = volume ÷ 24
      = 120 ÷ 24
      = 5 moles
```

### Example 3 (Combined)
**What volume of CO₂ is produced when 10g of calcium carbonate reacts with excess acid?**

**Equation:** CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂

**Step 1:** Moles of CaCO₃
```
Mr = 100
moles = 10 ÷ 100 = 0.1 moles
```

**Step 2:** Mole ratio 1:1 (1 CaCO₃ → 1 CO₂)
```
0.1 moles CaCO₃ → 0.1 moles CO₂
```

**Step 3:** Volume of CO₂
```
volume = 0.1 × 24 = 2.4 dm³
```
