## 1️⃣ Exothermic Reactions ⭐

### Definition
**Exothermic:** Transfers energy TO surroundings (usually as heat)

### Characteristics
- Temperature INCREASES
- Energy is RELEASED
- Feels HOT

### Examples
✅ Combustion (burning)
✅ Neutralization
✅ Oxidation (e.g., rusting)
✅ Respiration
✅ Hand warmers
✅ Self-heating cans

### Everyday Uses
- **Hand warmers** - iron oxidation releases heat
- **Self-heating cans** - calcium oxide + water
- **Cooking** - combustion reactions

---

## 2️⃣ Endothermic Reactions ⭐

### Definition
**Endothermic:** Takes in energy FROM surroundings

### Characteristics
- Temperature DECREASES
- Energy is ABSORBED
- Feels COLD

### Examples
✅ Thermal decomposition
✅ Photosynthesis
✅ Electrolysis
✅ Dissolving ammonium salts
✅ Sports injury packs

### Everyday Uses

## 3️⃣ Measuring Temperature Changes - Required Practical

### Method
1. Measure initial temperature
2. Mix reactants
3. Record highest/lowest temperature reached
4. Calculate temperature change

### Temperature Change
```
ΔT = final temperature - initial temperature

Exothermic: ΔT is POSITIVE (temp increases)
Endothermic: ΔT is NEGATIVE (temp decreases)
```

### Example
**Neutralization experiment:**
- Initial: 20°C
- Final: 28°C
- ΔT = 28 - 20 = +8°C (exothermic)

---

## 4️⃣ Reaction Profiles ⭐

### Exothermic Profile

```
Energy ↑
       │
       │  Reactants
       │     ●─────╮
       │           │ Activation
       │           │ Energy
       │           ╰────●

       │←──── Energy Released ────→│
       │
       └──────────────────────────→
                Reaction Progress
```

**Key features:**
- Products LOWER than reactants
- Energy released to surroundings
- ΔH is negative (Higher tier)

---

### Endothermic Profile

```

       │
       │              Products
       │               ●
       │              ╱

       │     ●─────╯
       │
       │←──── Energy Taken In ────→│
       │
       └──────────────────────────→
                Reaction Progress
```

**Key features:**
- Products HIGHER than reactants
- Energy absorbed from surroundings
- ΔH is positive (Higher tier)

---

## 5️⃣ Activation Energy

### Definition
**Activation energy:** Minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur

### On Profile Diagram
The "hump" or peak between reactants and products

### Why It's Important
- Explains why some reactions need heating to start
- Even exothermic reactions need initial energy input
- Example: Paper won't burn until you light it (provide activation energy)

---

## 6️⃣ Breaking and Making Bonds (Higher) ⭐

### Key Concept

**Breaking bonds:** REQUIRES energy (endothermic)
**Making bonds:** RELEASES energy (exothermic)

### Overall Energy Change

```
Energy change = Energy to break bonds - Energy released making bonds
```

**If more energy released than used:**
- Overall EXOTHERMIC
- Temperature increases

**If more energy used than released:**
- Overall ENDOTHERMIC
- Temperature decreases

---

### Bond Energy Calculations (Higher)

**Bond energy:** Energy needed to break 1 mole of a bond

### Method
1. Calculate energy needed to break ALL bonds in reactants
2. Calculate energy released making ALL bonds in products
3. Energy change = (bonds broken) - (bonds formed)

### Example: H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl

**Given bond energies:**
- H-H: 436 kJ/mol
- Cl-Cl: 242 kJ/mol
- H-Cl: 431 kJ/mol

**Step 1: Bonds broken (energy IN)**
- 1 × H-H = 436 kJ
- 1 × Cl-Cl = 242 kJ
- Total = 678 kJ

**Step 2: Bonds formed (energy OUT)**
- 2 × H-Cl = 2 × 431 = 862 kJ

**Step 3: Overall energy change**
```
= 678 - 862
= -184 kJ
```

**Negative = EXOTHERMIC** ✓

## 7️⃣ Cells and Batteries

### Simple Cell

**Components:**
- Two different metals (electrodes)
- Electrolyte (solution of ions)

**How it works:**
- More reactive metal becomes negative terminal
- Less reactive metal becomes positive terminal
- Chemical reactions produce electricity
- Electrons flow through wire (external circuit)

### Factors Affecting Voltage

**Higher voltage produced when:**
- Bigger difference in reactivity between metals
- Higher concentration of electrolyte
- Larger surface area of electrodes

### Example Cells

**Zinc and copper in salt solution:**
- Zinc more reactive → negative terminal
- Copper less reactive → positive terminal
- Voltage produced: ~1.1V

**Magnesium and copper:**
- Bigger reactivity difference
- Higher voltage (~1.7V)

---

### Batteries

**Battery =** Two or more cells connected together

**Non-rechargeable batteries:**
- Chemical reactions are irreversible
- Stop working when reactants used up
- Example: Alkaline batteries

**Rechargeable batteries:**
- Chemical reactions are reversible
- Can be recharged by applying external voltage
- Example: Lithium-ion batteries

---

## 8️⃣ Fuel Cells (Higher) ⭐

### Hydrogen Fuel Cell

**Overall reaction:**
```
Hydrogen + Oxygen → Water
2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
```

**How it works:**

**At negative electrode (anode):**
```
2H₂ → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻
(Hydrogen oxidised)
```

**At positive electrode (cathode):**
```
O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O
(Oxygen reduced)
```

**Overall:** Produces electricity + water (only waste product!)

---

### Advantages of Fuel Cells

✅ Only waste product is water (no pollution)
✅ More efficient than combustion engines
✅ Continuous supply if fuel supplied
✅ No need for recharging (unlike batteries)

### Disadvantages

❌ Hydrogen is flammable/explosive
❌ Difficult to store hydrogen safely
❌ Hydrogen often made from fossil fuels (not sustainable)
❌ Expensive technology
❌ Lack of hydrogen filling stations
