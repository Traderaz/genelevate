## 1️⃣ Crude Oil

### What Is It?
**Crude oil:** Mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and carbon only)

### Key Facts
- Formed from ancient dead organisms over millions of years
- Fossil fuel (finite/non-renewable resource)
- Mixture, not a compound
- Different molecules have different boiling points
- Separated by fractional distillation

### Hydrocarbons
**Hydrocarbon:** Compound containing ONLY hydrogen and carbon

**Examples:**
- Methane (CH₄)
- Ethane (C₂H₆)
- Propane (C₃H₈)

---

## 2️⃣ Alkanes ⭐

### General Formula
**CₙH₂ₙ₊₂**

### Homologous Series
**Alkanes are a homologous series:**
- Similar chemical properties
- Same general formula
- Differ by CH₂
- Gradual change in physical properties

### First 4 Alkanes to Memorize

| Name | Formula | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Methane** | CH₄ | C with 4 H |
| **Ethane** | C₂H₆ | 2 C in chain |
| **Propane** | C₃H₈ | 3 C in chain |
| **Butane** | C₄H₁₀ | 4 C in chain |

**Memory Aid:** **M**onkeys **E**at **P**eanut **B**utter

### Displayed Formulae

### Properties of Alkanes

**As molecules get longer:**
- Higher boiling point
- More viscous (thicker)
- Less flammable
- Less volatile (evaporate less easily)

| Alkane | Boiling Point |
|--------|---------------|
| Methane | -162°C (gas) |
| Ethane | -89°C (gas) |
| Propane | -42°C (gas) |
| Butane | -1°C (gas) |
| Pentane | 36°C (liquid) |

**Why?**
- Longer molecules have stronger intermolecular forces
- Need more energy to separate

---

### Combustion of Alkanes ⭐

**Complete combustion (plenty of oxygen):**
```
Hydrocarbon + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water

CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
```

**Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen):**
```
Hydrocarbon + oxygen → carbon monoxide + water

OR

Hydrocarbon + oxygen → carbon (soot) + water
```

**Why incomplete combustion is dangerous:**
- Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic/poisonous
- Binds to hemoglobin in blood
- Prevents oxygen transport
- Can be fatal
- Colorless and odorless (can't detect)

**Soot (carbon):**
- Causes breathing problems
- Global dimming (blocks sunlight)

---

## 3️⃣ Fractional Distillation ⭐

### The Process

**Purpose:** Separate crude oil into useful fractions

**How it works:**
1. Crude oil is heated to ~350°C (vaporizes most of it)
2. Vapor rises up fractionating column
3. Column is hotter at bottom, cooler at top
4. Different fractions condense at different heights
5. Liquids are collected

### Fractionating Column

```
Temperature ↓
          ↑
          │ Refinery gases (C₁-C₄) ← Smallest, lowest BP
          │
          │ Petrol (gasoline) (C₅-C₉)
          │
          │ Naphtha (C₇-C₁₄)
          │
          │ Kerosene (C₁₀-C₁₆)
          │
          │ Diesel (C₁₄-C₂₀)
          │
          │ Fuel oil (C₂₀-C₅₀)
          │
          │ Bitumen (>C₅₀) ← Largest, highest BP
          ↓
     Temperature ↑
```

### Fractions and Uses

| Fraction | Size | Uses |
|----------|------|------|
| Refinery gases | Very short | Camping gas, cooking |
| Petrol | Short | Car fuel |
| Naphtha | Short-medium | Making chemicals |
| Kerosene | Medium | Jet fuel, heating |
| Diesel | Medium-long | Diesel engines, heating |
| Fuel oil | Long | Ships, power stations |
| Bitumen | Very long | Roads, roofs |

### Why Fractionation Works

**Short molecules:**
- Low boiling point
- Don't condense easily
- Rise to top
- Collected at top

**Long molecules:**
- High boiling point
- Condense first
- Don't rise far
- Collected at bottom

---

## 4️⃣ Cracking ⭐

### Why Needed?
- Too much long-chain hydrocarbons (low demand)
- Not enough short-chain hydrocarbons (high demand)
- Cracking converts long → short

### Definition
**Cracking:** Breaking long hydrocarbon molecules into shorter, more useful ones

### Two Types

#### 1. Catalytic Cracking
- High temperature (600-700°C)
- Catalyst (aluminium oxide)
- Produces alkanes + alkenes

#### 2. Steam Cracking
- Very high temperature (800-900°C)
- Steam
- Produces alkenes (for plastics)

---

### The Reaction

**Example:**
```
Decane → Octane + Ethene
C₁₀H₂₂ → C₈H₁₈ + C₂H₄
(long)    (alkane  (alkene)
          for petrol) for plastics)
```

**Key Points:**
- Thermal decomposition reaction
- Produces alkanes (for fuels)
- Produces alkenes (for polymers/plastics)
- Alkenes are more reactive (have C=C double bond)

### Cracking Required Practical

**Lab method:**
1. Heat long-chain hydrocarbon (liquid paraffin) with catalyst
2. Vapors pass over hot catalyst
3. Short-chain products collected
4. Test with bromine water (goes colorless if alkene present)

---

## 5️⃣ Alkenes ⭐

### General Formula
**CₙH₂ₙ**

### Key Feature
**C=C double bond** (makes them reactive)

### First 3 Alkenes

| Name | Formula | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Ethene** | C₂H₄ | C=C with 4 H |
| **Propene** | C₃H₆ | 3 C, one C=C |
| **Butene** | C₄H₈ | 4 C, one C=C |

### Displayed Formulae

**Ethene:**
```
    H   H
     \ /
      C=C
     / \
    H   H
```

**Propene:**
```
    H   H   H
     \ /    |
      C=C—C—H
     /      |
    H       H
```

---

### Test for Alkenes

**Bromine water test:**
- Add alkene to orange bromine water
- **Positive result:** Orange → Colorless
- Proves C=C double bond present

**Alkanes:** No reaction (stay orange)
**Alkenes:** Decolorize (go colorless)

---

### Addition Reactions (Higher)

**Alkenes undergo addition reactions** (double bond opens up)

#### 1. Hydrogenation
```
Ethene + Hydrogen → Ethane
C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆

Conditions: Nickel catalyst, 150°C
```

**Used to make margarine** (liquid oils → solid fats)

---

#### 2. Halogenation
```
Ethene + Bromine → Dibromoethane
C₂H₄ + Br₂ → C₂H₄Br₂
```

---

#### 3. Hydration (Making Alcohols)
```
Ethene + Steam → Ethanol
C₂H₄ + H₂O → C₂H₅OH

Conditions: Catalyst, 300°C, 60 atm pressure
```

**Functional group test:** C=C double bond breaks, atoms add on

---

## 6️⃣ Polymers ⭐

### Definition
**Polymer:** Very long molecule made from many small molecules (monomers) joined together

**Monomer:** Small molecule that joins with others to make a polymer

### Polymerization

**Addition polymerization:**
- Many alkene molecules (monomers) join
- Double bond opens
- Forms long chain (polymer)

### Example: Poly(ethene)

**Monomer:** Ethene (C₂H₄)

```
Many ethene molecules:
H   H       H   H       H   H
 \ /         \ /         \ /
  C=C   +     C=C   +     C=C  → Poly(ethene)
 / \         / \         / \
H   H       H   H       H   H
```

**Polymer:**
```
    H   H   H   H   H   H
    |   |   |   |   |   |
—C—C—C—C—C—C—C—C—C—C—
    |   |   |   |   |   |
    H   H   H   H   H   H
           (continues...)
```

**Formula:** -(C₂H₄)ₙ- where n is very large

---

### Common Polymers and Uses

| Polymer | Monomer | Uses |
|---------|---------|------|
| Poly(ethene) | Ethene | Plastic bags, bottles |
| Poly(propene) | Propene | Ropes, crates |
| Poly(chloroethene) / PVC | Chloroethene | Pipes, window frames |
| Poly(styrene) | Styrene | Packaging, cups |

     \ /
      C=C
     / \
    H   H
```

**Polymer:**

    |   |
  —C—C—
    |   |
    H   H  ₙ
```
