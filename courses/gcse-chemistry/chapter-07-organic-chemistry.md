## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Crude Oil

### What Is It?
**Crude oil:** Mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and carbon only)

### Key Facts
- Formed from ancient dead organisms over millions of years
- Fossil fuel (finite/non-renewable resource)
- Mixture, not a compound
- Different molecules have different boiling points
- Separated by fractional distillation

### Hydrocarbons
**Hydrocarbon:** Compound containing ONLY hydrogen and carbon

**Examples:**
- Methane (CH‚ÇÑ)
- Ethane (C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÜ)
- Propane (C‚ÇÉH‚Çà)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Alkanes ‚≠ê

### General Formula
**C‚ÇôH‚ÇÇ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ**

### Homologous Series
**Alkanes are a homologous series:**
- Similar chemical properties
- Same general formula
- Differ by CH‚ÇÇ
- Gradual change in physical properties

### First 4 Alkanes to Memorize

| Name | Formula | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Methane** | CH‚ÇÑ | C with 4 H |
| **Ethane** | C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÜ | 2 C in chain |
| **Propane** | C‚ÇÉH‚Çà | 3 C in chain |
| **Butane** | C‚ÇÑH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ | 4 C in chain |

**Memory Aid:** **M**onkeys **E**at **P**eanut **B**utter

### Displayed Formulae

**Methane:**
```

**Ethane:**

### Properties of Alkanes

**As molecules get longer:**
- Higher boiling point
- More viscous (thicker)
- Less flammable
- Less volatile (evaporate less easily)

| Alkane | Boiling Point |
|--------|---------------|
| Methane | -162¬∞C (gas) |
| Ethane | -89¬∞C (gas) |
| Propane | -42¬∞C (gas) |
| Butane | -1¬∞C (gas) |
| Pentane | 36¬∞C (liquid) |

**Why?**
- Longer molecules have stronger intermolecular forces
- Need more energy to separate

---

### Combustion of Alkanes ‚≠ê

**Complete combustion (plenty of oxygen):**
```
Hydrocarbon + oxygen ‚Üí carbon dioxide + water

CH‚ÇÑ + 2O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CO‚ÇÇ + 2H‚ÇÇO
```

**Incomplete combustion (limited oxygen):**
```
Hydrocarbon + oxygen ‚Üí carbon monoxide + water

OR

Hydrocarbon + oxygen ‚Üí carbon (soot) + water
```

**Why incomplete combustion is dangerous:**
- Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic/poisonous
- Binds to hemoglobin in blood
- Prevents oxygen transport
- Can be fatal
- Colorless and odorless (can't detect)

**Soot (carbon):**
- Causes breathing problems
- Global dimming (blocks sunlight)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fractional Distillation ‚≠ê

### The Process

**Purpose:** Separate crude oil into useful fractions

**How it works:**
1. Crude oil is heated to ~350¬∞C (vaporizes most of it)
2. Vapor rises up fractionating column
3. Column is hotter at bottom, cooler at top
4. Different fractions condense at different heights
5. Liquids are collected

### Fractionating Column

```
Temperature ‚Üì
          ‚Üë
          ‚îÇ Refinery gases (C‚ÇÅ-C‚ÇÑ) ‚Üê Smallest, lowest BP
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Petrol (gasoline) (C‚ÇÖ-C‚Çâ)
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Naphtha (C‚Çá-C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ)
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Kerosene (C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ-C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ)
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Diesel (C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ-C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ)
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Fuel oil (C‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ-C‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ)
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ Bitumen (>C‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ) ‚Üê Largest, highest BP
          ‚Üì
     Temperature ‚Üë
```

### Fractions and Uses

| Fraction | Size | Uses |
|----------|------|------|
| Refinery gases | Very short | Camping gas, cooking |
| Petrol | Short | Car fuel |
| Naphtha | Short-medium | Making chemicals |
| Kerosene | Medium | Jet fuel, heating |
| Diesel | Medium-long | Diesel engines, heating |
| Fuel oil | Long | Ships, power stations |
| Bitumen | Very long | Roads, roofs |

### Why Fractionation Works

**Short molecules:**
- Low boiling point
- Don't condense easily
- Rise to top
- Collected at top

**Long molecules:**
- High boiling point
- Condense first
- Don't rise far
- Collected at bottom

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cracking ‚≠ê

### Why Needed?
- Too much long-chain hydrocarbons (low demand)
- Not enough short-chain hydrocarbons (high demand)
- Cracking converts long ‚Üí short

### Definition
**Cracking:** Breaking long hydrocarbon molecules into shorter, more useful ones

### Two Types

#### 1. Catalytic Cracking
- High temperature (600-700¬∞C)
- Catalyst (aluminium oxide)
- Produces alkanes + alkenes

#### 2. Steam Cracking
- Very high temperature (800-900¬∞C)
- Steam
- Produces alkenes (for plastics)

---

### The Reaction

**Example:**
```
Decane ‚Üí Octane + Ethene
C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄH‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ ‚Üí C‚ÇàH‚ÇÅ‚Çà + C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ
(long)    (alkane  (alkene)
          for petrol) for plastics)
```

**Key Points:**
- Thermal decomposition reaction
- Produces alkanes (for fuels)
- Produces alkenes (for polymers/plastics)
- Alkenes are more reactive (have C=C double bond)

### Cracking Required Practical

**Lab method:**
1. Heat long-chain hydrocarbon (liquid paraffin) with catalyst
2. Vapors pass over hot catalyst
3. Short-chain products collected
4. Test with bromine water (goes colorless if alkene present)

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Alkenes ‚≠ê

### General Formula
**C‚ÇôH‚ÇÇ‚Çô**

### Key Feature
**C=C double bond** (makes them reactive)

### First 3 Alkenes

| Name | Formula | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Ethene** | C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ | C=C with 4 H |
| **Propene** | C‚ÇÉH‚ÇÜ | 3 C, one C=C |
| **Butene** | C‚ÇÑH‚Çà | 4 C, one C=C |

### Displayed Formulae

**Ethene:**
```
    H   H
     \ /
      C=C
     / \
    H   H
```

**Propene:**

     \ /    |
      C=C‚ÄîC‚ÄîH
     /      |
    H       H
```

---

### Test for Alkenes

**Bromine water test:**
- Add alkene to orange bromine water
- **Positive result:** Orange ‚Üí Colorless
- Proves C=C double bond present

**Alkanes:** No reaction (stay orange)
**Alkenes:** Decolorize (go colorless)

---

### Addition Reactions (Higher)

**Alkenes undergo addition reactions** (double bond opens up)

#### 1. Hydrogenation
```
Ethene + Hydrogen ‚Üí Ethane
C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ + H‚ÇÇ ‚Üí C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÜ

Conditions: Nickel catalyst, 150¬∞C
```

**Used to make margarine** (liquid oils ‚Üí solid fats)

---

#### 2. Halogenation
```
Ethene + Bromine ‚Üí Dibromoethane
C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ + Br‚ÇÇ ‚Üí C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑBr‚ÇÇ
```

---

#### 3. Hydration (Making Alcohols)
```
Ethene + Steam ‚Üí Ethanol
C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÑ + H‚ÇÇO ‚Üí C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖOH

Conditions: Catalyst, 300¬∞C, 60 atm pressure
```

**Functional group test:** C=C double bond breaks, atoms add on
