## 1️⃣ Purity and Formulations

### Pure Substances

**In chemistry, pure means:**
- Contains only ONE substance
- No other substances mixed in
- Has fixed melting/boiling point

**In everyday language:**
- "Pure orange juice" contains multiple substances!
- Not pure in chemical sense

### Testing Purity

**Melting/Boiling Point:**
- Pure substance: Sharp, fixed melting/boiling point
- Impure substance: Melts/boils over a range of temperatures

**Example:**
- Pure water boils at exactly 100°C
- Salt water boils above 100°C (impure)

---

### Formulations ⭐

**Formulation:** Mixture designed for a specific purpose with precise quantities

**Examples:**
- **Paints:** Pigment + solvent + binder + additives
- **Medicines:** Active drug + fillers + coatings
- **Fuels:** Mixture of hydrocarbons + additives
- **Cleaning products:** Detergents + water + fragrances
- **Cosmetics:** Various chemicals in exact amounts

**Why useful:**
- Each component has specific function
- Carefully tested and optimized
- Consistent quality

---

## 2️⃣ Chromatography ⭐

### Definition
**Chromatography:** Technique to separate and identify substances in a mixture

### How It Works

**Two phases:**
1. **Stationary phase:** Paper (doesn't move)
2. **Mobile phase:** Solvent (moves up paper)

**Process:**
1. Draw pencil baseline
2. Put spots of mixture on baseline
3. Place in solvent (below baseline)
4. Solvent travels up paper
5. Carries substances with it
6. Different substances travel different distances

---

### Method - Required Practical

1. Draw pencil line 1-2 cm from bottom (baseline)
2. Use capillary tube to spot mixture on line
3. Place paper in beaker with small amount of solvent
4. Solvent level BELOW baseline
5. Wait for solvent to travel up paper
6. Remove before solvent reaches top
7. Mark solvent front
8. Measure distances

**Why pencil not pen?**
- Pen ink would dissolve and mix with samples
- Pencil is insoluble

---

### Interpreting Chromatograms

**Number of spots = Number of different substances**

**Example:**
```
Solvent front ────────────
                    ●          ← Pure A
                ●              ← Pure B
            ●                  ← Pure C
        
Baseline ─●────●────●────●───
        Mix    A    B    C
```

**Mix contains:** A and C (matches spot positions)

---

### Rf Values ⭐

**Rf = Retention factor**

```
       distance moved by substance
Rf = ─────────────────────────────
     distance moved by solvent
```

**Key points:**
- Always between 0 and 1
- Same substance = same Rf value (in same conditions)
- Can identify substances by comparing Rf values

### Example Calculation

```
Solvent travels: 10 cm
Substance travels: 7 cm

Rf = 7 ÷ 10 = 0.7
```

### Example Question

A substance travels 4.5 cm. The solvent travels 9 cm.

```
Rf = 4.5 ÷ 9 = 0.5
```

**Exam Tip:** ALWAYS show your working!

## 3️⃣ Tests for Gases ⭐

Must memorize all 4!

| Gas | Test | Positive Result |
|-----|------|-----------------|
| **Hydrogen (H₂)** | Burning splint | **Squeaky pop** |
| **Oxygen (O₂)** | Glowing splint | **Relights** |
| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | Bubble through limewater | **Turns milky/cloudy** |
| **Chlorine (Cl₂)** | Damp litmus paper | **Bleaches white** |

### Details

**Hydrogen:**
- Collect gas in test tube
- Place burning splint at mouth of tube
- Hear squeaky pop if H₂ present

**Oxygen:**
- Collect gas in test tube
- Place glowing (not burning) splint in tube
- Splint relights if O₂ present

**Carbon Dioxide:**
- Bubble gas through limewater (calcium hydroxide solution)
- Turns cloudy/milky if CO₂ present
- Equation: Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O

**Chlorine:**
- Hold damp blue litmus paper in gas
- Turns white (bleached) if Cl₂ present
- Toxic gas - use fume cupboard!

---

## 4️⃣ Flame Tests ⭐

### Method
1. Clean nichrome wire loop in HCl
2. Dip in sample
3. Hold in blue Bunsen flame
4. Observe color

### Flame Colors - Memorize!

| Metal Ion | Flame Color |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Lithium (Li⁺)** | **Crimson/Red** |
| **Sodium (Na⁺)** | **Yellow/Orange** |
| **Potassium (K⁺)** | **Lilac/Purple** |
| **Calcium (Ca²⁺)** | **Orange-red** |
| **Copper (Cu²⁺)** | **Blue-green** |

**Memory Aid:** **L**ily **R**an, **N**ancy **Y**elled, **K**arl **P**aused, **C**athy **O**rdered, **C**opper **G**reen

**Why clean wire?**
- Previous sample can contaminate
- Gives false results
- Sodium especially masks other colors

---

## 5️⃣ Metal Hydroxide Precipitate Tests ⭐

### Method
1. Add few drops of **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)** solution
2. Observe precipitate color

### Results Table

| Metal Ion | Color of Precipitate |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Calcium (Ca²⁺)** | **White** |
| **Copper (Cu²⁺)** | **Blue** |
| **Iron(II) (Fe²⁺)** | **Green** |
| **Iron(III) (Fe³⁺)** | **Brown/orange** |
| **Aluminium (Al³⁺)** | **White** (dissolves in excess NaOH) |
| **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** | **White** |

### Equations (Higher)

**Example: Copper ions**
```
Cu²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq) → Cu(OH)₂(s)
                      (blue precipitate)
```

**Example: Iron(III)**
```
Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq) → Fe(OH)₃(s)
                      (brown precipitate)
```

---

### Distinguishing Calcium, Magnesium, Aluminium

**All give white precipitates!**

**How to tell apart:**
- **Calcium:** White precipitate, flame test = orange-red
- **Magnesium:** White precipitate, no distinctive flame color
- **Aluminium:** White precipitate that **dissolves in excess NaOH**

---

## 6️⃣ Tests for Anions (Negative Ions) ⭐

### Carbonate Test (CO₃²⁻)

**Method:**
1. Add dilute acid (HCl or H₂SO₄)
2. Bubble gas through limewater

**Positive result:**
- Fizzing/effervescence
- Gas produced turns limewater cloudy
- This proves carbonate present

**Equation:**
```
CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂
```

---

### Sulfate Test (SO₄²⁻)

**Method:**
1. Add dilute **hydrochloric acid** (removes carbonates)
2. Add **barium chloride (BaCl₂)** solution

**Positive result:**
- **White precipitate** forms
- Barium sulfate (BaSO₄)

**Equation:**
```
Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)
                        (white)
```

**Why add HCl first?**
- Carbonates also form white precipitate with barium
- HCl removes carbonates first
- Ensures result is definitely sulfate

---

### Halide Tests (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻)

**Method:**
1. Add dilute **nitric acid** (removes carbonates)
2. Add **silver nitrate (AgNO₃)** solution

**Results:**

| Halide Ion | Precipitate Color |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Chloride (Cl⁻)** | **White** |
| **Bromide (Br⁻)** | **Cream** |
| **Iodide (I⁻)** | **Yellow** |

**Memory Aid:** **C**hlor **W**hite, **B**rom **C**ream, **I**od **Y**ellow

**Equations:**
```
Ag⁺ + Cl⁻ → AgCl (white)
Ag⁺ + Br⁻ → AgBr (cream)
Ag⁺ + I⁻ → AgI (yellow)
```

- Very sensitive and accurate

### Advantages
- Detects very small amounts
- Fast
- Can analyze mixtures
- Accurate identification

### How It Works
1. Sample heated in flame
2. Electrons excited to higher energy levels
3. Electrons fall back, emit light
4. Light passed through spectroscope
5. Produces unique line spectrum
6. Computer compares to database

**Each element has unique spectrum** (like a fingerprint)
