## üî¨ Required Practicals

You must be able to describe methods and analyze results for:

1. **Making salts** (Chapter 4) - Neutralization reactions
2. **Measuring temperature changes** (Chapter 5) - Exothermic/endothermic
3. **Rate of reaction experiments** (Chapter 6) - Gas volume or mass change

## üìê Key Formulas

```
Moles = mass (g) √∑ Mr

Concentration (g/dm¬≥) = mass (g) √∑ volume (dm¬≥)

Concentration (mol/dm¬≥) = moles √∑ volume (dm¬≥)

Rf value = distance moved by substance √∑ distance moved by solvent

Percentage yield = (actual yield √∑ theoretical yield) √ó 100%

Atom economy = (Mr of desired product √∑ total Mr of reactants) √ó 100%

Rate of reaction = amount of product (or reactant) √∑ time

Volume of gas (dm¬≥) = moles √ó 24 (at RTP)
```
