## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Chemical Bonds

### Three Main Types

| Bond Type | Formed Between | What Happens |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Ionic** | Metal + Non-metal | Electrons transferred |
| **Covalent** | Non-metal + Non-metal | Electrons shared |
| **Metallic** | Metal + Metal | Electrons delocalized |

### Quick Decision Tree
```
Is there a metal?
    ‚Üì
   YES ‚Üí Metal + Metal? ‚Üí METALLIC
         Metal + Non-metal? ‚Üí IONIC
    ‚Üì
   NO ‚Üí Non-metal + Non-metal ‚Üí COVALENT
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ionic Bonding ‚≠ê

### What Happens
1. Metal **loses** electrons ‚Üí becomes **positive ion** (cation)
2. Non-metal **gains** electrons ‚Üí becomes **negative ion** (anion)
3. Opposite charges **attract** = ionic bond

### Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

**Sodium (2,8,1):**
- Loses 1 electron
- Becomes Na‚Å∫ (2,8)

**Chlorine (2,8,7):**
- Gains 1 electron
- Becomes Cl‚Åª (2,8,8)

**Ionic bond:** Na‚Å∫ and Cl‚Åª attract each other

### Common Ions to Memorize

**Positive Ions (Cations):**
- Li‚Å∫, Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫ (Group 1 - lose 1e‚Åª)
- Mg¬≤‚Å∫, Ca¬≤‚Å∫ (Group 2 - lose 2e‚Åª)
- Al¬≥‚Å∫ (Group 3 - loses 3e‚Åª)
- Cu¬≤‚Å∫, Fe¬≤‚Å∫, Fe¬≥‚Å∫ (transition metals)
- NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ (ammonium)

**Negative Ions (Anions):**
- F‚Åª, Cl‚Åª, Br‚Åª, I‚Åª (Group 7 - gain 1e‚Åª)
- O¬≤‚Åª (Group 6 - gains 2e‚Åª)
- OH‚Åª (hydroxide)
- NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª (nitrate)
- CO‚ÇÉ¬≤‚Åª (carbonate)
- SO‚ÇÑ¬≤‚Åª (sulfate)

### Dot and Cross Diagrams ‚≠ê

**Rules:**
- Show outer shell electrons only
- Dots for one element, crosses for the other
- Square brackets [ ] around ions
- Show charges outside brackets

**Example: MgO**

```
      [O]¬≤‚Åª        Mg¬≤‚Å∫
   x x x x x
  x    O    x
   x x x x x

Mg loses 2e‚Åª ‚Üí Mg¬≤‚Å∫ (2,8)
O gains 2e‚Åª ‚Üí O¬≤‚Åª (2,8)
```

**Exam Tip:** 4 marks = draw both ions with charges shown!

### Properties of Ionic Compounds

| Property | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **High melting/boiling points** | Strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions need lots of energy to break |
| **Conduct when molten/dissolved** | Ions are free to move and carry charge |
| **Don't conduct when solid** | Ions are fixed in position in the lattice |
| **Brittle** | Layers can slide, like charges repel, structure breaks |
| **Soluble in water (usually)** | Water molecules can attract and surround ions |

### Giant Ionic Lattice Structure

- Regular 3D arrangement
- Each ion surrounded by oppositely charged ions
- Strong electrostatic attraction in all directions
- Example: NaCl (sodium chloride)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Covalent Bonding ‚≠ê

### What Happens
- Non-metal atoms **share** pairs of electrons
- Both atoms attracted to the shared electrons
- This is the covalent bond

### Simple Covalent Molecules

**Number of Bonds:**
- Group 4 (C) ‚Üí 4 bonds
- Group 5 (N) ‚Üí 3 bonds
- Group 6 (O) ‚Üí 2 bonds
- Group 7 (Cl) ‚Üí 1 bond

### Common Molecules to Know

**H‚ÇÇ (Hydrogen):**
- H‚ÄîH
- Single covalent bond
- Each H shares 1 electron

**Cl‚ÇÇ (Chlorine):**
- Cl‚ÄîCl
- Single bond
- Each Cl shares 1 electron

**H‚ÇÇO (Water):**
- H‚ÄîO‚ÄîH
- Two single bonds
- O shares 2 electrons (1 with each H)

**NH‚ÇÉ (Ammonia):**
- Three H‚ÄîN bonds
- N shares 3 electrons

**CH‚ÇÑ (Methane):**
- Four H‚ÄîC bonds
- C shares 4 electrons
- Tetrahedral shape

**O‚ÇÇ (Oxygen):**
- O‚ïêO
- **Double bond** (share 4 electrons)

**CO‚ÇÇ (Carbon Dioxide):**
- O‚ïêC‚ïêO
- Two double bonds

**N‚ÇÇ (Nitrogen):**
- N‚â°N
- **Triple bond** (share 6 electrons)
- Very strong, unreactive

### Dot and Cross Diagrams - Covalent

**Rules:**
- Show outer shell electrons
- Overlapping region = shared electrons
- No charges (molecules are neutral)

**Example: Water (H‚ÇÇO)**
```
       H  x
        \ /
    x x O x x
        / \
       H  x

O has 6 outer electrons (x)
Each H has 1 electron (‚Ä¢)
2 shared pairs = 2 covalent bonds
```

### Displayed Formulae

Shows all atoms and bonds:
- **H‚ÄîH** (hydrogen)
- **H‚ÄîO‚ÄîH** (water)
- **O‚ïêO** (oxygen)
- **H‚ÄîC‚ÄîH** (methane, with 4 H around C)
      |
      H

### Properties of Simple Covalent Molecules

| Property | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Low melting/boiling points** | Weak intermolecular forces between molecules (not the covalent bonds!) |
| **Don't conduct electricity** | No free electrons or ions to carry charge |
| **Often liquids/gases at room temp** | Because of weak forces between molecules |

**Key Concept:** Strong covalent bonds WITHIN molecules, weak forces BETWEEN molecules

| **Shiny** | Reflect light |

### Alloys

**Definition:** Mixtures of metals (or metal + other element)

**Why stronger than pure metals:**
- Different sized atoms
- Distorts the regular layers
- Harder for layers to slide
- **Alloys are harder than pure metals**

**Common Alloys:**

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ States of Matter

### Three States

|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Solid** | Regular pattern, close together | Vibrate in fixed positions | Strong |
| **Liquid** | Random arrangement, close together | Move around each other | Moderate |
| **Gas** | Random, far apart | Fast, random motion | Weak |

### State Changes

```
    MELTING          BOILING/EVAPORATING
Solid ------‚Üí Liquid ------‚Üí Gas
      ‚Üê------        ‚Üê------
   FREEZING      CONDENSING

        SUBLIMATION
Solid ----------------‚Üí Gas
```

**Key Terms:**
- **Melting:** Solid ‚Üí Liquid (requires energy)
- **Freezing:** Liquid ‚Üí Solid (releases energy)
- **Boiling:** Liquid ‚Üí Gas (requires energy)
- **Condensing:** Gas ‚Üí Liquid (releases energy)
- **Evaporating:** Liquid ‚Üí Gas (at surface, any temperature)
- **Sublimation:** Solid ‚Üí Gas directly (e.g., dry ice)

### Limitations of Models

**Particle model doesn't show:**
- ‚ùå Forces between particles
- ‚ùå Size of particles
- ‚ùå Space between particles (not to scale)
- ‚ùå Movement of particles

**Always mention these limitations if asked!**
