## 1️⃣ Atoms, Elements and Compounds

### Key Concepts

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Atom** | Smallest particle of an element | Hydrogen atom (H) |
| **Element** | Substance made of one type of atom only | Oxygen (O₂), Iron (Fe) |
| **Compound** | Two or more elements chemically bonded | Water (H₂O), CO₂ |
| **Mixture** | Two or more substances not chemically bonded | Air, sea water |

### Must-Know Formulae

- **Water:** H₂O (2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen)
- **Carbon dioxide:** CO₂ (1 carbon, 2 oxygen)
- **Methane:** CH₄ (1 carbon, 4 hydrogen)
- **Ammonia:** NH₃ (1 nitrogen, 3 hydrogen)
- **Sulfuric acid:** H₂SO₄ (2 hydrogen, 1 sulfur, 4 oxygen)
- **Calcium carbonate:** CaCO₃ (1 calcium, 1 carbon, 3 oxygen)

### Common Exam Mistakes ❌
- Confusing elements with compounds
- Not multiplying brackets correctly: Ca(OH)₂ = 1 Ca, 2 O, 2 H (NOT 1 Ca, 1 O, 2 H)
- Forgetting that compounds have different properties from their elements

---

## 2️⃣ Separating Mixtures

### Quick Reference Table

| Mixture Type | Separation Method | Why It Works |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Insoluble solid + liquid | **Filtration** | Solid trapped by filter paper |
| Soluble solid + liquid | **Crystallisation** | Evaporate some water, crystals form |
| Solvent from solution | **Simple distillation** | Boil liquid, condense vapour |
| Two+ liquids | **Fractional distillation** | Different boiling points |
| Dyes/inks | **Chromatography** | Different solubilities |

### Chromatography Key Points

**Rf Value Formula:**
```
Rf = distance moved by substance
     ────────────────────────────
     distance moved by solvent
```

**Always between 0 and 1**

**Required Practical Alert:** You must be able to calculate Rf values!

### Exam Technique: Describing Separations

**Command Word:** "Describe how to separate..."

**Answer Structure:**
1. Name the method
2. Describe the apparatus/setup
3. Explain the process step-by-step
4. State what you collect/obtain

---

## 3️⃣ Development of the Atomic Model

### Timeline Summary

| Year | Scientist | Model | Key Discovery |
|------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| 1803 | **Dalton** | Solid sphere | Atoms are tiny, indivisible spheres |
| 1897 | **Thomson** | Plum pudding | Discovered electrons (negative particles) |
| 1911 | **Rutherford** | Nuclear model | Dense, positive nucleus; mostly empty space |
| 1913 | **Bohr** | Electron shells | Electrons orbit in fixed energy levels |
| 1932 | **Chadwick** | Modern model | Discovered neutrons |

### Rutherford's Alpha Scattering Experiment ⭐

**The Experiment:**
- Fired alpha particles (positive) at thin gold foil
- Observed where they went

**Observations → Conclusions:**

| What Happened | What It Showed |
|---------------|----------------|
| Most passed straight through | Atom is mostly empty space |
| Some deflected at large angles | Small positive nucleus present |
| Very few bounced back | Nucleus is very small and dense |

**6-Mark Question Alert:** This experiment is frequently worth 6 marks - learn all observations AND conclusions!

---

## 4️⃣ Atomic Structure

### Subatomic Particles

| Particle | Mass | Charge | Location |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| **Proton** | 1 | +1 | Nucleus |
| **Neutron** | 1 | 0 | Nucleus |
| **Electron** | 1/1836 (≈0) | -1 | Shells |

### Standard Notation

```
   A  ← Mass number (protons + neutrons)
   Z X
   ↑
   Atomic number (protons)
```

### Quick Calculations

**Given:** ²³₁₁Na

- **Protons** = 11 (atomic number)
- **Electrons** = 11 (same as protons in neutral atom)
- **Neutrons** = 23 - 11 = **12** (mass number - atomic number)

---

## 5️⃣ Isotopes

### Definition
**Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons

### Key Points
✅ Same protons (same element)  
✅ Different neutrons (different mass)  
✅ Same electrons (same chemical properties)

### Example: Chlorine Isotopes

- **Cl-35:** 17 protons, 18 neutrons (75% abundance)
- **Cl-37:** 17 protons, 20 neutrons (25% abundance)

### Relative Atomic Mass (Ar) Calculation ⭐

**Formula:**
```
Ar = (mass₁ × abundance₁) + (mass₂ × abundance₂) + ...
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
                          100
```

**Example: Calculate Ar of chlorine**

```
Ar = (35 × 75) + (37 × 25)
     ─────────────────────
            100

   = 2625 + 925
     ─────────
        100

   = 35.5
```

**Exam Tip:** Show ALL working. Each step = 1 mark!

## 6️⃣ Electronic Structure

### Shell Rules (First 20 Elements)
- **1st shell:** max 2 electrons
- **2nd shell:** max 8 electrons
- **3rd shell:** max 8 electrons
- **Fill from the inside out**

### Quick Reference Table

| Element | Atomic No. | Electronic Structure |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Hydrogen | 1 | 1 |
| Helium | 2 | 2 |
| Lithium | 3 | 2, 1 |
| Carbon | 6 | 2, 4 |
| Oxygen | 8 | 2, 6 |
| Sodium | 11 | 2, 8, 1 |
| Magnesium | 12 | 2, 8, 2 |
| Chlorine | 17 | 2, 8, 7 |
| Argon | 18 | 2, 8, 8 |
| Potassium | 19 | 2, 8, 8, 1 |
| Calcium | 20 | 2, 8, 8, 2 |

### Common Exam Question
**"Explain why sodium and potassium have similar chemical properties."** (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
- Both are in Group 1 ✓
- Both have 1 electron in their outer shell ✓
- Chemical properties depend on outer shell electrons ✓

---

## 7️⃣ The Periodic Table

### How It's Organized

**Periods (Rows):**
- Period number = number of electron shells
- Properties change across a period (metal → non-metal)

**Groups (Columns):**
- Group number = number of outer shell electrons
- Elements in same group have similar properties

### Finding Electronic Structure from Position

**Element in Period 3, Group 5:**
- 3 shells (Period 3)
- 5 outer electrons (Group 5)
- **Electronic structure: 2, 8, 5**

### Mendeleev's Periodic Table ⭐

**What he did right:**
- Arranged by atomic mass (mostly)
- Left gaps for undiscovered elements
- Predicted properties accurately
- Swapped some elements to keep similar ones together

**Why it worked:**
- He had unknowingly arranged by atomic number (proton number)
- Modern table uses atomic number, not mass

**Exam Question Alert:** "Why did Mendeleev leave gaps?" is a common 2-3 mark question!

---

## 8️⃣ Group 1 - Alkali Metals

### Properties
- Soft metals (cut with knife)
- Low melting points
- Very reactive
- React with water → hydrogen gas + alkali
- Store in oil (to prevent air/water contact)

### Reactivity Trend
**Reactivity INCREASES going down the group**

Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs
(least reactive → most reactive)

### Reactions with Water

**General equation:**
```
Alkali metal + water → metal hydroxide + hydrogen

2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂
```

**Observations:**

| Metal | Observations |
|-------|--------------|
| Lithium | Fizzes steadily, floats |
| Sodium | Melts into ball, fizzes quickly, moves around |
| Potassium | Lilac flame, very vigorous, may ignite |

### Why Reactivity Increases ⭐ (Higher Tier)

Going down Group 1:
- More electron shells
- Outer electron further from nucleus
- Weaker attraction to nucleus
- Easier to lose outer electron
- **More reactive**

---

## 9️⃣ Group 7 - Halogens

### Properties
- Non-metals
- Exist as diatomic molecules (F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂)
- Colored
- Toxic
- Form ionic compounds with metals

### Physical Properties

| Halogen | Color | State at 20°C | Boiling Point |
|---------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Fluorine (F₂) | Pale yellow | Gas | -188°C |
| Chlorine (Cl₂) | Green | Gas | -34°C |
| Bromine (Br₂) | Red-brown | Liquid | 59°C |
| Iodine (I₂) | Grey/purple | Solid | 184°C |

### Reactivity Trend
**Reactivity DECREASES going down the group**

F > Cl > Br > I
(most reactive → least reactive)

### Displacement Reactions ⭐

**Rule:** More reactive halogen displaces less reactive halogen

**Example:**
```
Chlorine + potassium bromide → potassium chloride + bromine

Cl₂ + 2KBr → 2KCl + Br₂
```

✅ Chlorine is more reactive than bromine = reaction occurs

**Observation:** Solution turns orange (bromine formed)

### Why Reactivity Decreases (Higher Tier)

Going down Group 7:
- More electron shells
- Outer shell further from nucleus
- Harder to attract an extra electron
- **Less reactive**

---

## 🔟 Group 0 - Noble Gases

### Properties
- Unreactive (inert)
- Monatomic (exist as single atoms)
- Full outer shell of electrons
- Low boiling points
- Non-flammable

### Elements & Uses

| Gas | Use | Why? |
|-----|-----|------|
| Helium | Balloons, airships | Less dense than air, non-flammable |
| Neon | Lighting/signs | Glows red-orange when electricity passes through |
| Argon | Light bulbs, welding | Inert atmosphere prevents reactions |
| Krypton | Photography, lasers | Produces bright light |

### Why They're Unreactive ⭐

- Full outer shell of electrons (stable electronic structure)
- No tendency to lose, gain, or share electrons
- Very stable

**Helium:** 2 (full first shell)  
**Others:** 2, 8, 8 or 2, 8, 18, 8, etc. (full outer shell)

### Boiling Point Trend

**Boiling points INCREASE going down the group**

He < Ne < Ar < Kr < Xe
(lowest → highest)

**Why?** More electrons = stronger intermolecular forces

---

### Question 7
**Level 2 Answer (3-4 marks):**
- Potassium has more electron shells than sodium ✓
- The outer electron is further from the nucleus ✓
- There is weaker attraction between the nucleus and outer electron ✓
- So it's easier for potassium to lose its outer electron / potassium is more reactive ✓

**Examiner Tip:** Use comparative language: "more", "further", "weaker", "easier"

---

### Question 8
a) **Chlorine + potassium bromide → potassium chloride + bromine** ✓

(Symbols: Cl₂ + 2KBr → 2KCl + Br₂ also accepted)

b) 
- Chlorine is more reactive than bromine ✓
- So chlorine displaces bromine from the compound ✓

---

### Question 9
a) **Group 0** ✓ (or Group 8)

b) **They have full outer shells (of electrons) / stable electronic structure** ✓

---

### Question 10
**Level 3 Answer (5-6 marks):**

**Arrangement:**
- Mendeleev arranged elements in order of atomic mass ✓
- Elements with similar properties were placed in the same groups/columns ✓
- He left gaps for undiscovered elements ✓

**Why successful:**
- He predicted the properties of missing elements accurately ✓
- When these elements were discovered (e.g., germanium), his predictions were correct ✓
- He sometimes swapped the order to keep similar elements together ✓

**Extra credit:** This worked because he had unknowingly arranged by atomic number
