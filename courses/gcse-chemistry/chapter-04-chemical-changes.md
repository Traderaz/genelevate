## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Displacement Reactions

### The Rule
**A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its compound**

### Examples

**‚úÖ Will React:**
```
Magnesium + copper sulfate ‚Üí magnesium sulfate + copper
Mg + CuSO‚ÇÑ ‚Üí MgSO‚ÇÑ + Cu
```
(Mg is more reactive than Cu)

**‚ùå Won't React:**
```
Copper + magnesium sulfate ‚Üí NO REACTION
```
(Cu is less reactive than Mg)

### Observations in Displacement

**When zinc displaces copper from copper sulfate:**
- Blue solution turns colorless
- Brown copper metal forms
- Temperature increases (exothermic)
- Zinc dissolves

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Metal Extraction and Reduction

### How Metals Are Extracted

| Metal | Found As | Extraction Method | Why |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Gold, Silver | Native (pure) | Just dig up | Very unreactive |
| Copper to Zinc | Oxides | Reduction with carbon | Less reactive than carbon |
| Aluminium to Potassium | Oxides | Electrolysis | More reactive than carbon |

### Reduction with Carbon

**Example: Iron Extraction**
```
Iron oxide + carbon ‚Üí iron + carbon dioxide
2Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ + 3C ‚Üí 4Fe + 3CO‚ÇÇ
```

**Why it works:**
- Carbon is more reactive than iron
- Carbon removes oxygen from iron oxide
- Iron is **reduced** (loses oxygen)

**Key Term:** **Reduction** = Loss of oxygen (or gain of electrons)

### Why Aluminium Needs Electrolysis
- Aluminium is MORE reactive than carbon
- Carbon can't displace it
- Must use electricity (electrolysis)
- More expensive method

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Oxidation and Reduction (Redox) ‚≠ê

### Definitions

**Oxidation:**
- Gain of oxygen
- Loss of electrons
- **OIL** - Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons)

**Reduction:**
- Loss of oxygen
- Gain of electrons
- **RIG** - Reduction Is Gain (of electrons)

**Redox reaction:** Oxidation and reduction happen together

### Example: Magnesium + Oxygen

```
2Mg + O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2MgO

Magnesium is OXIDISED (gains oxygen)
```

### Example: Displacement Reaction

```
Zn + CuO ‚Üí ZnO + Cu

Zn is OXIDISED (gains oxygen)
Cu is REDUCED (loses oxygen)
```

### In Terms of Electrons (Higher)

```
Mg ‚Üí Mg¬≤‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª    (oxidation - loses electrons)
Cu¬≤‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª ‚Üí Cu    (reduction - gains electrons)
```

**Remember: OIL RIG!**

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reactions of Acids

### Acids React With:

**1. Metals ‚Üí Salt + Hydrogen**
```
acid + metal ‚Üí salt + hydrogen

Mg + 2HCl ‚Üí MgCl‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇ
```

**Test for hydrogen:** Squeaky pop with lit splint

---

**2. Metal Oxides ‚Üí Salt + Water**
```
acid + metal oxide ‚Üí salt + water

CuO + H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ ‚Üí CuSO‚ÇÑ + H‚ÇÇO
```

---

**3. Metal Hydroxides ‚Üí Salt + Water**
```
acid + metal hydroxide ‚Üí salt + water

NaOH + HCl ‚Üí NaCl + H‚ÇÇO
```

This is **neutralization**

---

**4. Metal Carbonates ‚Üí Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide**
```
acid + metal carbonate ‚Üí salt + water + CO‚ÇÇ

CaCO‚ÇÉ + 2HCl ‚Üí CaCl‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO + CO‚ÇÇ
```

**Test for CO‚ÇÇ:** Turns limewater milky

---

### Which Salt is Formed?

**Salt name = Metal + Acid part**

| Acid | Salt Formed |
|------|-------------|
| Hydrochloric acid (HCl) | Chloride |
| Sulfuric acid (H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ) | Sulfate |
| Nitric acid (HNO‚ÇÉ) | Nitrate |

**Examples:**
- Copper + sulfuric acid ‚Üí **copper sulfate** + ...
- Zinc + hydrochloric acid ‚Üí **zinc chloride** + ...
- Sodium hydroxide + nitric acid ‚Üí **sodium nitrate** + ...

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ pH Scale and Neutralization ‚≠ê

### The pH Scale

```
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
  ACIDS      NEUTRAL    ALKALIS

Strong acids    Weak acids    Weak alkalis    Strong alkalis
pH 0-2          pH 3-6        pH 8-11         pH 12-14
```

### Common Examples

| Substance | pH | Type |
|-----------|-----|------|
| Car battery acid | 0 | Strong acid |
| Stomach acid | 1-2 | Strong acid |
| Lemon juice | 2 | Acid |
| Vinegar | 3 | Weak acid |
| Pure water | 7 | Neutral |
| Baking soda | 9 | Weak alkali |
| Soap | 10 | Alkali |
| Bleach | 12 | Strong alkali |
| Drain cleaner | 14 | Strong alkali |

### Universal Indicator Colors

```
Red ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Purple
 1       3        5       7       11      14
Acid ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Neutral ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Alkali
```

### Neutralization

**Acid + Alkali ‚Üí Salt + Water**

**Example:**
```
HCl + NaOH ‚Üí NaCl + H‚ÇÇO
```

**Ionic equation (Higher):**
```
H‚Å∫ + OH‚Åª ‚Üí H‚ÇÇO
```

This is the same for ALL neutralizations!

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Making Salts - Required Practical ‚≠ê

### Method 1: Acid + Insoluble Base (Metal Oxide/Hydroxide)

**Best for:** Making soluble salts from insoluble bases

**Method:**
1. Add excess base to warm acid
2. Stir until no more dissolves
3. Filter to remove excess base
4. Heat filtrate to evaporate some water
5. Leave to crystallize
6. Filter and dry crystals

**Example:** Making copper sulfate
```
CuO + H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ ‚Üí CuSO‚ÇÑ + H‚ÇÇO
```

---

### Method 2: Acid + Alkali (Titration)

**Best for:** Making soluble salts when both reactants are soluble

**Method:**
1. Use indicator to find exact volumes needed
2. Repeat without indicator
3. Evaporate water to get salt crystals

**Example:** Making sodium chloride
```
HCl + NaOH ‚Üí NaCl + H‚ÇÇO
```

---

### Method 3: Precipitation

**Best for:** Making INSOLUBLE salts

**Method:**
1. Mix two soluble salt solutions
2. Insoluble salt forms as precipitate
3. Filter to collect precipitate
4. Wash with distilled water
5. Dry

**Example:** Making lead iodide (yellow precipitate)
```
Pb(NO‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÇ + 2KI ‚Üí PbI‚ÇÇ + 2KNO‚ÇÉ
```

---

### Solubility Rules to Memorize

**ALWAYS Soluble:**
- All nitrates
- All chlorides (except silver chloride)
- All sulfates (except barium sulfate, calcium sulfate)
- Sodium, potassium, ammonium salts

**Usually Insoluble:**
- Carbonates (except sodium, potassium, ammonium)
- Hydroxides (except sodium, potassium, calcium)

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Electrolysis ‚≠ê

### Definition
**Electrolysis:** Using electricity to break down a compound (ionic)

### Key Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Electrolyte** | Ionic compound that is molten or dissolved |
| **Anode** | Positive electrode |
| **Cathode** | Negative electrode |
| **Cation** | Positive ion (goes to cathode) |
| **Anion** | Negative ion (goes to anode) |

**Memory Aid:** 
- Cation ‚Üí Cathode (both have 't')
- Anion ‚Üí Anode (both start with 'an')

### What Happens

**At the CATHODE (-):**
- Positive ions attracted
- Gain electrons (reduction)
- Metal or hydrogen formed

**At the ANODE (+):**
- Negative ions attracted
- Lose electrons (oxidation)
- Non-metal (often oxygen or chlorine) formed

---

### Electrolysis of Molten Compounds

**Example: Molten lead bromide (PbBr‚ÇÇ)**

**At cathode (-):**
```
Pb¬≤‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª ‚Üí Pb
(lead metal forms)
```

**At anode (+):**
```
2Br‚Åª ‚Üí Br‚ÇÇ + 2e‚Åª
(bromine gas forms)
```

**Simple rule:** Metal at cathode, non-metal at anode

---

### Electrolysis of Aqueous Solutions (Higher)

**More complex because water is present!**

**At CATHODE (-):**
- If metal is LESS reactive than hydrogen ‚Üí metal forms
- If metal is MORE reactive than hydrogen ‚Üí hydrogen forms

**At ANODE (+):**
- If halide present (Cl‚Åª, Br‚Åª, I‚Åª) ‚Üí halogen forms
- Otherwise ‚Üí oxygen forms (from water)

### Example: Sodium Chloride Solution

**At cathode (-):**
```
2H‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª ‚Üí H‚ÇÇ
(Hydrogen, not sodium - Na is too reactive)
```

**At anode (+):**
```
2Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ + 2e‚Åª
(Chlorine gas)
```

---

### Half Equations (Higher) ‚≠ê

**Rules for writing:**
1. Write the ion
2. Add electrons (e‚Åª) to balance charge
3. Balance atoms if needed

**Cathode (Reduction - gain electrons):**
```
Cu¬≤‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª ‚Üí Cu
Al¬≥‚Å∫ + 3e‚Åª ‚Üí Al
2H‚Å∫ + 2e‚Åª ‚Üí H‚ÇÇ
```

**Anode (Oxidation - lose electrons):**
```
2Cl‚Åª ‚Üí Cl‚ÇÇ + 2e‚Åª
2O¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí O‚ÇÇ + 4e‚Åª
2Br‚Åª ‚Üí Br‚ÇÇ + 2e‚Åª
```

---

### Aluminium Extraction

**Ore:** Bauxite (aluminium oxide, Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ)

**Process:**
1. Al‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ dissolved in molten cryolite (lowers melting point, saves energy)
2. Electrolysis used

**At cathode (-):**
```
Al¬≥‚Å∫ + 3e‚Åª ‚Üí Al
(liquid aluminium sinks to bottom)
```

**At anode (+):**
```
2O¬≤‚Åª ‚Üí O‚ÇÇ + 4e‚Åª
(oxygen gas)
```

**Problem:** Oxygen reacts with carbon anodes, forming CO‚ÇÇ
- Anodes need regular replacement
- Expensive!
