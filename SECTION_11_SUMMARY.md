## 📊 Data Structure

### Year Group Type
```typescript
export type YearGroup = 'year-6' | 'year-9-11' | 'year-12-13';

export interface YearGroupInfo {
  id: YearGroup;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  description: string;
  ageRange: string;
  stage: string;
  focusAreas: string[];
  emoji: string;
}
```

### User Profile
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  // ... other fields
  yearGroup: YearGroup | null;  // ✅ Updated from string
}
```

### Content Tagging
```typescript
interface Course {
  // ... other fields
  yearGroups: YearGroup[];  // Can target multiple year groups
}

interface Webinar {
  // ... other fields
  yearGroups: YearGroup[];  // Can target multiple year groups
}
```

## 🔍 Filtering Logic

### How It Works
1. **User Selects Year Group** in dropdown filter
2. **URL Updates** with `?yearGroup=year-9-11`
3. **Firestore Query** filters content:
   ```typescript
   query(
     collection(db, 'courses'),
     where('yearGroups', 'array-contains', 'year-9-11'),
     where('status', '==', 'published'),
     orderBy('isFeatured', 'desc')
   )
   ```
4. **Results Display** only relevant content

### Firestore Indexes Used
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "courses",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "yearGroups", "arrayConfig": "CONTAINS" },
    { "fieldPath": "subject", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "isFeatured", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### In User Registration
```typescript
import { YearGroupSelector } from '@/components/year-groups/year-group-selector';

<YearGroupSelector
  selectedYearGroup={yearGroup}
  onSelect={setYearGroup}
  label="Select Your Year Group"
  required
/>
```

### In Content Filtering
```typescript
import { YearGroupFilter } from '@/components/year-groups/year-group-filter';

<YearGroupFilter
  selectedYearGroup={currentYearGroup}
  onFilterChange={handleYearGroupChange}
  showAllOption={true}
/>
```

### Getting Year Group Info
```typescript
import { getYearGroupInfo, getYearGroupColor } from '@/types/year-groups';

const info = getYearGroupInfo('year-9-11');
// Returns: { name: 'Years 9-11', displayName: 'Years 9-11 (GCSE)', ... }

const colorClass = getYearGroupColor('year-9-11');
// Returns: 'text-purple-500 bg-purple-500/10 border-purple-500/20'
```
