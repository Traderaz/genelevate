  - LinkedIn and website URL fields
  - Areas of expertise selection (Mathematics, Science, etc.)
  - GDPR and terms consent
  - Email verification
  - Admin approval requirement

### 3. Content Creator Dashboard
- **URL**: `/creator-dashboard`
- **Location**: `apps/web/src/app/creator-dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Content management interface
  - Statistics dashboard (views, ratings, content count)
  - Quick actions for creating webinars and courses
  - Approval status indicator
  - Content creation tools access

### 4. Role-Based Access Control
- **Location**: `apps/web/src/lib/role-permissions.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive permission system
  - Route-based access control
  - Content creators are restricted from:

### 5. Protected Routes

- **Creator Dashboard**: Protected with `ContentCreatorOnlyGuard`

### 6. Security Features
- Role-based navigation redirects
- Unauthorized access page (`/unauthorized`)
- Automatic role-based dashboard routing
- Content creator isolation from student features

## Access URLs

### For Content Creators:
- **Sign-up**: `https://yourdomain.com/creator-signup`
- **Dashboard**: `https://yourdomain.com/creator-dashboard`

### Key Files Modified/Created:

#### Type System:
- `packages/shared/src/types/common.ts` - Added content-creator role
- `apps/web/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Updated user profile interface

#### Authentication & Authorization:
- `apps/web/src/lib/role-permissions.ts` - Role-based permission system
- `apps/web/src/components/auth/role-guard.tsx` - Route protection components
- `apps/web/src/app/unauthorized/page.tsx` - Unauthorized access page

#### Content Creator Pages:
- `apps/web/src/app/creator-signup/page.tsx` - Registration page
- `apps/web/src/app/creator-dashboard/page.tsx` - Creator dashboard
- `apps/web/src/app/creator-dashboard/layout.tsx` - Protected layout

#### Protected Routes:
- `apps/web/src/app/courses/page.tsx` - Student-only access
- `apps/web/src/app/ai/page.tsx` - Student-only access
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Excludes content creators

## User Flow

### Content Creator Registration:
1. Visit `/creator-signup` (link-only access)
2. Fill professional registration form
3. Email verification sent
4. Account created with `isApproved: false`
5. Admin approval required
6. Email notification on approval
7. Access to creator dashboard

### Content Creator Experience:
1. Login redirects to `/creator-dashboard`
2. Can create webinars and courses
3. Cannot access student features
4. Cannot access payment features
5. Isolated content management system

## Admin Requirements

### Database Fields Added:
```typescript
// User document for content creators
{
  role: 'content-creator',
  bio: string,
  expertise: string[],
  linkedinUrl?: string,
  websiteUrl?: string,
  isApproved: boolean,
  approvedAt?: Date,
  contentCreated: number,
  totalViews: number,
  rating: number
}
```

### Admin Actions Needed:
1. Approve content creator accounts
2. Monitor content creation
3. Manage creator permissions
4. Handle creator support requests

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Isolation**: Content creators cannot access student data or features
2. **Approval Process**: All creators require admin approval before content is visible
3. **Route Protection**: All sensitive routes are protected with role guards
4. **Permission System**: Granular permissions prevent unauthorized access
5. **Separate Navigation**: Creators get their own navigation system

## Next Steps

1. Implement content creation forms for webinars/courses
2. Add admin approval interface
3. Create content moderation system
4. Add analytics for creator content
5. Implement creator payment/revenue sharing (if needed)

## Usage

To access the content creator sign-up, share this direct link:
`https://yourdomain.com/creator-signup`

Content creators will be automatically redirected to their dashboard upon login and cannot access student features or paid content.
