  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow write: if isGlobalAdmin();
}

## API Integration (Production)

### News Sources to Integrate

1. **News API** (newsapi.org)
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch(
     `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${keywords}&apiKey=${apiKey}`
   );
   ```

2. **RSS Feeds**
   - TechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/feed/
   - Wired: https://www.wired.com/feed/rss
   - The Guardian Tech: https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology/rss

3. **Job Board APIs**
   - Indeed API
   - LinkedIn Jobs API
   - Reed API (UK-specific)

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

```typescript
interface NewsAdapter {
  fetchNews(params: NewsSearchParams): Promise<NewsArticle[]>;
}

class NewsAPIAdapter implements NewsAdapter {
  async fetchNews(params: NewsSearchParams): Promise<NewsArticle[]> {
    // Fetch from News API
    // Transform to our NewsArticle format
    return articles;
  }
}

class RSSFeedAdapter implements NewsAdapter {
  async fetchNews(params: NewsSearchParams): Promise<NewsArticle[]> {
    // Parse RSS feeds
    // Transform to our NewsArticle format
    return articles;
  }
}
```

## Navigation Integration

### Header Navigation
- Added "Careers" link to main navigation
- Accessible from all pages
- Position: Between "Webinars" and "Pricing"

### Dashboard Sidebar
- Added "Careers" link with briefcase icon
- Position: After "Live Webinars"
- Accessible from all dashboard pages

## User Experience

### Career Explorer Flow
1. User navigates to `/careers`
2. Sees banner with quick stats and search preview
3. Views career statistics (500+ paths, 25 sectors, etc.)
4. Uses filters to narrow down careers by:
   - Sector (Technology, Engineering, etc.)
   - Location (London, Manchester, etc.)
   - Education level (Bachelor's, Master's, etc.)
5. Searches by keywords (job title, skills, etc.)
6. Clicks on a career card to view details
7. Explores career progression pathway
8. Views related courses
9. Reads industry insights

### Industry News Flow
1. User sees news feed on careers page (right sidebar)
2. Views latest articles with trending indicators
3. Filters by category (Technology, Engineering, etc.)
4. Clicks "Read more" to view full article
5. Bookmarks interesting articles (future feature)
6. Sees auto-refresh timestamp

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side
- **Lazy loading**: News feed and career cards load on demand
- **Debounced search**: Search input debounced to reduce queries
- **Cached filters**: Filter options cached in component state
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant filter updates before data loads

### Server-Side
- **Firestore indexes**: All query combinations indexed
- **Batch operations**: News refresh uses batched writes
- **Query limits**: Pagination for large result sets
- **Scheduled functions**: Off-peak processing (6 AM UTC)

    // Test sector filtering
  });
  
  it('should search careers by keyword', async () => {
    // Test search functionality
  });
  
  it('should display career details', async () => {
    // Test detail page rendering
  });
});

describe('Industry News Feed', () => {
  it('should load latest news articles', async () => {
    // Test news loading
  });
  
  it('should filter by category', async () => {
    // Test category filtering
  });
});
```

## Deployment

### Initial Setup
1. Deploy Firestore security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. Deploy Firestore indexes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
3. Deploy Cloud Functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`
4. Seed initial career data (admin panel or script)
5. Test manual news refresh: Call `manualRefreshIndustryNews`

### Monitoring
- Check Cloud Function logs: `firebase functions:log`
- Monitor Firestore usage in Firebase Console
- Track API quotas for external news sources
- Set up alerts for function failures

## Cost Estimates

### Firebase Costs (Monthly)
- **Firestore reads**: ~50K reads/day × 30 = 1.5M reads/month = $0.18
- **Firestore writes**: ~100 writes/day × 30 = 3K writes/month = $0.03
- **Cloud Functions**: 1 execution/day × 30 = 30 executions/month = $0.00 (free tier)
- **Total Firebase**: ~$0.21/month

### External API Costs (Monthly)
- **News API**: Free tier (100 requests/day) or $449/month (unlimited)
- **Job Board APIs**: Varies by provider
- **Estimated Total**: $0-500/month depending on scale

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Daily**: Monitor Cloud Function execution
- **Weekly**: Review trending careers and news
- **Monthly**: Update career data (salaries, growth rates)
- **Quarterly**: Audit and clean up old data

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: News not refreshing
