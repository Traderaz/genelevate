Four Humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile. Imbalance = illness. Church controlled medicine, encouraged prayer. Doctors trained at universities, very expensive. Most people used herbal remedies, local healers. Limited progress due to Church authority and classical texts being unquestioned.', examples: [{question: 'Explain two features of medical treatment in medieval England (4 marks)', workingOut: 'Feature 1: Bloodletting\nMedieval doctors used bloodletting to treat illness. This involved cutting a vein or using leeches to remove blood. They believed this would rebalance the Four Humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) which they thought caused disease when imbalanced.\n\nFeature 2: Religious treatments\nPrayer and pilgrimage were common treatments. People believed illness was punishment from God or caused by evil spirits. They would pray to saints, visit holy shrines, or pay for masses to be said, hoping for divine healing.', answer: 'Bloodletting to rebalance humours; Prayer/pilgrimage for divine healing', explanation: 'Two features = 2 paragraphs.
