**READING SKILLS FOR GCSE**

**Paper 1: Fiction (Creative Reading)**
- Extracts from novels, short stories
- Focus: narrative techniques, character, atmosphere
- Questions on language, structure, evaluation

**Paper 2: Non-Fiction (Writers' Viewpoints)**
- Articles, speeches, letters, reports
- Focus: perspective, argument, persuasion
- Comparison of two texts

**KEY READING TECHNIQUES:**

**1. ANNOTATION**
- Underline key quotations
- Circle powerful words
- Note techniques in margins
- Mark structure features

**2. LANGUAGE ANALYSIS**
- Identify techniques: metaphor, simile, personification
- Explain EFFECT of language choices
- Consider connotations and imagery
- Link to writer's intentions

**3. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS**
- How text begins and ends
- Shifts in focus or perspective
- Paragraph/sentence structure
- Use of dialogue vs description

**4. INFERENCE**
- Read between the lines
- What is suggested but not stated?
- Consider context clues
- Support with evidence

**LANGUAGE TECHNIQUES:**

**Metaphor:** Direct comparison (not using like/as)
"The classroom was a zoo"

**Simile:** Comparison using like/as
"He ran like the wind"

**Personification:** Giving human qualities to non-human
"The wind whispered through the trees"

**Alliteration:** Repeated initial sounds
"Peter Piper picked..."

**Onomatopoeia:** Sound words
"Crash! Bang! Splash!"

**Repetition:** Repeating words/phrases for emphasis

**Rhetorical question:** Question not requiring answer

**Emotive language:** Words that create emotion

**PEE STRUCTURE:**

**Point:** Make your argument
**Evidence:** Quote from text
**Explanation:** Analyze the effect

Example:
"The writer creates tension through short sentences. 'He stopped. Silence. Nothing.' This fragmented structure mirrors the character's panic, making readers feel his fear."

    examples: [
      {
        question: 'How does the writer use language to create atmosphere in the opening?',
        workingOut: `Structure your answer:

Introduction: State overall atmosphere
Point 1: Identify first technique + effect
Evidence: Quote
Explanation: Analyze
Point 2: Second technique
Evidence + Explanation
Point 3: Third technique
Evidence + Explanation
Conclusion: Overall effect

Example answer:
"The writer creates an eerie, unsettling atmosphere through careful language choices. The description of 'shadows creeping' uses personification to make the darkness seem alive and threatening. This makes readers feel the character's vulnerability. Additionally, the simile 'silent as a tomb' emphasizes the unnatural quiet while also suggesting death, heightening tension. The writer also uses sensory imagery: 'damp, musty air' appeals to smell and touch, making the setting feel oppressive and real. Together, these techniques immerse readers in a sinister atmosphere that foreshadows danger."`,
        answer: 'Multi-paragraph analytical response using PEE',
        explanation: 'Identify 3+ techniques, quote precisely, explain effects, link to writer\'s purpose. Use subject terminology accurately.'

- Development: how ideas/story progresses
- Shifts: changes in time, place, focus
- Paragraph lengths: short for impact, long for detail
- Sentence types: questions, statements, exclamations
- Ending: circular, open, resolution

Example:
"The writer structures the text to build suspense. The opening paragraph is short and fragmented: 'Late. Dark. Alone.' This immediately creates unease. In contrast, the middle section uses longer, detailed description to slow the pace, making readers anticipate danger. The final paragraph returns to short sentences, creating a rushed, panicked tone that mirrors the climax."`,
