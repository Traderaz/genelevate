  {moduleNumber: 2, title: 'Memory', duration: '115 min', introduction: 'Multi-store model, working memory, forgetting, eyewitness testimony', keyPoints: ['Multi-store model: sensory, STM, LTM', 'Working memory model', 'Encoding, storage, retrieval', 'Interference theory', 'Loftus & Palmer'], explanation: 'How we remember and forget', examples: [
    {question: 'Describe and evaluate the Multi-Store Model of memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968)', workingOut: 'DESCRIPTION:\n\nThree stores:\n\n1. Sensory Register\n- Capacity: Huge (all sensory info)\n- Duration: <0.5 seconds\n- Encoding: Sense-specific (iconic, echoic)\n- Info from environment\n\n2. Short-Term Memory (STM)\n- Capacity: 7±2 items (Miller, 1956)\n- Duration: 18-30 seconds\n- Encoding: Mainly acoustic\n- From sensory via ATTENTION\n- Maintenance rehearsal keeps info here\n\n3. Long-Term Memory (LTM)\n- Capacity: Unlimited\n- Duration: Lifetime\n- Encoding: Mainly semantic\n- From STM via REHEARSAL\n- Retrieval brings back to STM\n\nEVALUATION:\n\nStrengths:\n+ Research support (HM case study)\n+ Brain scan evidence (different areas)\n+ Explains primacy/recency effect\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Too simplistic (STM not unitary)\n- Rehearsal not only way to LTM\n- Doesn\'t explain flashbulb memories\n- Working memory model better explains STM\n\nConclusion: Influential but oversimplified', answer: 'Three stores: sensory, STM (7±2, 18-30s), LTM (unlimited)', explanation: 'Linear model: sensory → STM → LTM via attention and rehearsal'},
    {question: 'Explain the Working Memory Model (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)', workingOut: 'PURPOSE: Explains STM as active processor, not passive store\n\nCOMPONENTS:\n\n1. Central Executive\n- Supervisory role\n- Allocates attention to slave systems\n- Limited capacity\n- Modality-free\n\n2. Phonological Loop (verbal info)\n- Phonological store (inner ear)\n- Articulatory process (inner voice)\n- Capacity: ~2 seconds of speech\n- Explains word-length effect\n\n3. Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad (visual info)\n- Visual cache (what things look like)\n- Inner scribe (spatial relations)\n- Capacity: 3-4 objects\n- Mental rotation tasks\n\n4. Episodic Buffer (added 2000)\n- Integrates information\n- Links working memory to LTM\n- Temporary store\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Dual-task studies\n- If both tasks use same slave system: interference\n- Different systems: no interference\n- Brain imaging shows different areas active\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n+ Explains dual-task performance\n+ Applied to reading difficulties\n+ More detailed than MSM\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n- Central executive vague\n- Doesn\'t explain link to LTM (until buffer added)', answer: 'Active STM: central executive + 3 slave systems', explanation: 'WMM: explains how we manipulate information in STM'},
    {question: 'Describe interference theory of forgetting', workingOut: 'THEORY: Forgetting occurs because memories interfere with each other\n\nTWO TYPES:\n\n1. Proactive Interference (PI)\n- OLD learning interferes with NEW\n- Example: Can\'t remember new phone number\n  because old one keeps coming to mind\n- "Pro" = forward\n\n2. Retroactive Interference (RI)\n- NEW learning interferes with OLD\n- Example: Learning Spanish interferes\n  with previously learned French\n- "Retro" = backward\n\nRESEARCH SUPPORT:\nMcGeoch & McDonald (1931)\n- Participants learn list A\n- Then learn list B (synonyms/numbers/etc)\n- Recall list A\n- Most interference when lists similar\n- Shows RI effect\n\nEVALUATION:\nStrengths:\n+ Lab evidence\n+ Explains why revision timetables work\n+ Real-world applications\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Artificial tasks (word lists)\n- Doesn\'t explain all forgetting\n- Retrieval failure also important\n\nCONCLUSION:\nInterference is ONE cause of forgetting\nEspecially when material similar', answer: 'PI: old→new. RI: new→old. Interference causes forgetting', explanation: 'Interference: memories compete, causing forgetting'},
    {question: 'Evaluate Loftus & Palmer (1974) eyewitness testimony study', workingOut: 'AIM: Investigate effect of leading questions on memory\n\nMETHOD:\n- 45 students shown car crash videos\n- Asked: "How fast were cars going when they ___?"\n- Verbs: smashed, collided, bumped, hit, contacted\n- Different verb for each group\n\nRESULTS:\n- "Smashed": estimated 40.8 mph\n- "Contacted": estimated 31.8 mph\n- Verb affected speed estimate\n\nEXPERIMENT 2:\n- Week later: "Did you see broken glass?"\n- "Smashed" group: 32% said yes\n- Control: 14% said yes\n- (There was NO broken glass)\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- Leading questions alter memory\n- Either:\n  1. Response bias (change answer not memory)\n  2. Substitution (actually change memory)\n\nEVALUATION:\nStrengths:\n+ Lab experiment (high control)\n+ Clear cause-effect\n+ Practical applications (police interviews)\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Low ecological validity (video not real)\n- Students (not representative)\n- Lacks emotional impact of real crash\n- Ethical issues (distress)\n\nIMPLICATIONS:\n- Cognitive interview developed\n- Police training improved\n- Legal system awareness', answer: 'Leading questions significantly distort eyewitness memory', explanation: 'Loftus & Palmer: demonstrates reconstructive memory'}
