## 🎯 How It Works

### Weekly Debate Cycle

#### **Phase 1: Topic Generation (Sunday)**
```
Admin → AI generates 5 topics → Admin selects → Debate created
```
- AI suggests engaging, age-appropriate topics
- Admin reviews and approves
- Debate scheduled for Monday-Sunday

#### **Phase 2: Active Debate (Monday-Saturday)**
```
Student → Record/Write → Submit → AI Scores → Leaderboard Updates
```
1. Student views debate topic
2. Chooses position (for/against/neutral)
3. Submits argument:
   - **Video**: Up to 60 seconds
   - **Audio**: Up to 60 seconds
   - **Text**: 50-500 words
4. AI scores in ~30-60 seconds
5. Student receives detailed feedback
6. Leaderboard updates in real-time

#### **Phase 3: Leaderboard Finalization (Sunday)**
```
System → Calculate Rankings → Award Bonuses → Send Notifications
```
- Final rankings calculated
- Bonus points awarded (Rank #1: +500 points!)
- Badges distributed
- Summary emails sent
- Debate archived

#### **Phase 4: New Week (Monday)**
- Process repeats with new topic
